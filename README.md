A WIP NutScript Schema
This schema has been being worked on for a long time, that being the case it has a lot of older and deprecated plugins. The file structure will also be a bit disorganized.
This is mainly being uploaded so that other Nutscript developers can use what they want from it, or learn from some of the stuff it does to do whatever. 

Do not expect me to fix too many minor bugs, especially in plugins that I did not create. This will be updated infrequently, usually only after I implement a decent amount of content.

The SWEPs that the weapon items use are not included as I did not create them myself, I will also not give them to you (I have been asked not to).

NEW 
I have recently updated the schema to the Nutscript 1.1 Beta branch. This means the master branch is no longer compatible with the pre-beta framework. There is another branch (poorly) named Beta if you want a version that (mostly) works with pre-beta NS 1.1.
