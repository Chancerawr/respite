[00:46:40]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: Hey.
[00:46:44]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Oh. Uh, hello.
[00:46:49]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: gives her a puzzled look. 
[00:46:55]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: How's it going, weary traveler?
[00:47:00]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Makeshift Spear'(#375696)
[00:47:05]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Meaty Stew'(#1075660)
[00:47:06]	[ME] 'Verstand': seemed to be at a loss of words, mumbling something to themselves as they stepped two steps towards you. "Your eyes are.. Bleeding? Do you not feel it? It's.. It's all over your face! You need some help!"
[00:47:09]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Riotshield'(#1008713)
[00:47:11]	[LOOC] Markus Wilder: your spear went up again
[00:47:14]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Enhanced Backpack'(#1027019)
[00:47:29]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'take' to item 'Makeshift Spear'(#375696)
[00:47:33]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Makeshift Spear'(#375696)
[00:47:34]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: looks away awkwardly, scratching his cheek. "Oooh, that, its really fine, its just a curse is all."
[00:47:38]	[IC] Monika Brandt: I -- fine. No. No, I need to stop saying that. It's terrible. I hate it. I hate literally everything -- I -- I'm sorry, I don't even know you and I am breaking down in front of you.
[00:47:42]	[ME] Monika Brandt: chuckles nervously.
[00:48:01]	[IC] Markus Wilder: How?
[00:48:20]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: I will be right back.
[00:48:42]	[ME] Alexandria Pierson: shrugged, "It's fine. At least you're not an asshole. Wanna' talk about it or somethin'? I'm no therapist, but we're all in this shithole together so..." She offered a smile, before putting her makeshfit sword away
[00:49:00]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Anyways...if you dont mind a long walk i can give you the blight at my place. 
[00:49:00]	[ME] 'Verstand': raised their brows a bit, wondering if he was sick or something else. "I hope you get better, you don't.. I mean, you have those Ghost Limbs and now bleeding out of your eyes and some.. Orb in your chest. I think you need a cure and fast.." They sound concerned, the general condition of the person infront of them was the definition of un-human. "Well, I-.. Sorry for getting off-topic, do you have the blight to spare..?"
[00:49:28]	[IC] 'Verstand': Sure, I can walk. I don't think anyone can steal my work..
[00:49:37]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: laughs slighty. "Well, i have alot wrong with me currently, none of it is really too threatening though."
[00:49:39]	[ME] 'Verstand': says, pointing behind them to a crate that seems to leak with meat.
[00:49:40]	[IC] Monika Brandt: I... maybe. Not really, but... kind of.
[00:49:48]	[IC] 'Verstand': Really? Is that.. Orb your heart?
[00:50:03]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'Stack' to item 'Assorted Screws'(#1085453)
[00:50:07]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Nope, but it lets me perform a neat little trick..like...
[00:50:15]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: He just was saying stuff. I don't remember exactly but it was just like.. I told him I didn't really want to go to Kier's Faux anymore, and since I got rid of the potion. And he kept pushing it, saying I should go to Rat, and that like.. *ugh*. I dunno. It just irritated me.
[00:50:29]	Harper Kennedy tried 'take' to item 'Chip'(#1085580)
[00:50:33]	Harper Kennedy tried 'take' to item 'Empty Water Bottle'(#1085592)
[00:50:39]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: raises a hand, the blood tears seem to float away from his face collecting in a smalll ball hovering in the air.
[00:50:53]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'Stack' to item 'Glass'(#1085402)
[00:51:14]	[ME] Alexandria Pierson: nodded, "Well uh, I have a home near the gas station. Don't really feel very safe out here, especially next to 'Meat Central'." Hinting towards the city filled with meat pillars and the like, "Names Alexandria. Nice to meet ya, though wish circumstances were better."
[00:51:16]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: looks at her with a little smirk,and in a showoffish flourish, the ball takes the shape of a flower, before crystallizing over. He hands it to her rather proud of the piece.
[00:51:23]	[IC] Markus Wilder: He has no respect for your decisions.
[00:51:39]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Monika. And... yes. I wish they were better, too.
[00:51:46]	[IC] Markus Wilder: He just wants you to be with Kier, no matter what it takes, even if you wouldn't actually be with him.
[00:51:52]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: Yeah..
[00:51:55]	[ME] 'Verstand': eyes went WIDE. "Woah! Wh-.. Are you some.. Some.." They tried to come up with the words, blurting out the first thing that came to mind. "A wizard?!" they were rather amazed at the bit of art displayed, they even took the piece, but then quickly dropped it. "Oh!" realizing that it was someone's blood.
[00:51:57]	[ME] Markus Wilder: shakes his head, looking away.
[00:52:02]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Absolute cretin.
[00:52:10]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'take' to item 'Riotshield'(#1008713)

[00:52:14]	[IC] 'Verstand': I-.. Sorry? I just don't do too good with Human blood.. Everything else is.. Fine but.. People's blood.
[00:52:14]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'take' to item 'Meaty Stew'(#1075660)
[00:52:18]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: I agree.
[00:52:20]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'Equip' to item 'Makeshift Spear'(#375696)
[00:52:34]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: bursts out laughing, nearly doubling over "Ho-holy shit- a fuckin wizard? Oh my god thats the best thing i've been called in awhile."
[00:52:52]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Ahh- no worries,  c'mon lets get your blight.
[00:53:04]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: Nice to meet ya, Monika. By the way, if you go into the city don't think you're gonna' find anything except for monster meat. Just sayin'. Everything is covered in meat and it smells like someone took a massive shit and smeared it on every single dirt grain and brick that was put in that city.
[00:53:10]	[IC] Monika Brandt: I noticed.
[00:53:14]	[IC] Monika Brandt: I keep telling people to stay away.
[00:53:16]	[RADIO] Kaz Ancrath: Harper get this, fresh hot take.
[00:53:18]	[IC] Monika Brandt: They are... not smart.
[00:53:20]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: Either of you have a single shard-dust?
[00:53:26]	[RADIO] Harper Kennedy: What?
[00:53:28]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: starts walking as he speaks intot he radio.
[00:53:32]	[ME] 'Verstand': chuckled a bit, a sense of at-ease flowing through them, noticing that he wasn't enraged by their rather quick drop of the flower. "Hahaha! Oh please, all you're missing is a pointy hat! C'mon! No one can.. Can do that normally! You've got to teach me! My friends say I have a mind like a fortress!"
[00:53:34]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Afraid not.
[00:53:37]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: Yeah...though that's a major scavengin' spot, so.
[00:53:40]	[RADIO] Kaz Ancrath: Im a *wizard*
[00:53:43]	[IC] 'Verstand': Sure, sure.. Lead the way, Wizard!
[00:53:44]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: No.
[00:53:44]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: Hmm... A shame.
[00:53:48]	[RADIO] 'Verstand': He is!
[00:53:49]	[RADIO] Harper Kennedy: What did you do?
[00:53:59]	[RADIO] 'Verstand': He can bend blood! Make.. Make things out of it!
[00:54:09]	[RADIO] Kaz Ancrath: I shovved this girl vvhat i can do vvith blood and she called me a vvizard.
[00:54:15]	[RADIO] Kaz Ancrath: The people have spoken.
[00:54:15]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Hamburger Helper'(#1056991)
[00:54:16]	[IC] 'Verstand': Hey..
[00:54:17]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Spent all mine on this one's Christmas present.

[00:54:21]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Monster Meat'(#1076721)

[00:54:27]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Vvhat?
[00:54:30]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: The tree?
[00:54:32]	[IC] 'Verstand': Can you control that? The spire..?
[00:54:47]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Haha nooo... thats basically a monster factory.
[00:54:51]	[IC] 'Verstand': Oh.
[00:54:59]	[RADIO] Alexandria Pierson: Lucas did the same thing yesterday. Made his hand into a crazy ass spear, so I guess we have multiple 'wizards'.
[00:55:04]	[IC] 'Verstand': I vvas thinking that might have been your VVizard tovver!
[00:55:06]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Monster Meat'(#1080773)
[00:55:08]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: Pfft.
[00:55:15]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: What was the gift?
[00:55:19]	[IC] Markus Wilder: A shard.
[00:55:19]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: A Shard.
[00:55:19]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: Well uh...what now.
[00:55:26]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Oh my god.

[00:55:40]	[RADIO] Harper Kennedy: kaz...stop giving the new people false hope.
[00:55:41]	[IC] 'Verstand': VVhy not fight the Monsters for one, then?
[00:55:42]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: Kiddin'.
[00:55:48]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: Using a special artifact, I can propel tiny pieces of metal at hundreds of meters per second, enough to destroy flesh and sometimes even pierce armor.
[00:55:59]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: Whatever you have done probably has an explanation.
[00:56:02]	[RADIO] 'Verstand': VVhat!? Hovv do I do this!?
[00:56:03]	[ME] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: would continue looking through his crates and speaks under his breath, "Sorta."
[00:56:04]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: That tree is full of jacked up monsters and gunships no thanks
[00:56:14]	[IC] 'Verstand': Oh, vvovv..
[00:56:17]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Well, I'm lame, then.
[00:56:19]	[RADIO] Harper Kennedy: See...I told you Kaz...now they want to do it
[00:56:22]	[IC] 'Verstand': VVhy do vve live so close, then?
[00:56:29]	[RADIO] Kaz Ancrath: That was monikas fault.
[00:56:35]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: I hope you are just joking when you ask me how to do that.
[00:56:40]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: WHat do you mean?
[00:56:44]	[RADIO] 'Verstand': I'm not. It sounds cool!
[00:56:47]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: Nah, you are pretty *cool*.
[00:56:50]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: It's a gun.
[00:56:51]	[RADIO] 'Verstand': Wait..
[00:56:54]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: I am describing guns.
[00:56:55]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'Scrap' to item 'Power Saw'(#1075373)
[00:56:56]	[RADIO] 'Verstand': Bah! Beat me!

[00:57:31]	Harper Kennedy tried 'take' to item 'Chip'(#1085594)
[00:57:34]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Rhert man, I want you to know I appreciate you.
[00:57:36]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Probably irrationally so.
[00:57:36]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: You needed five?
[00:57:36]	Harper Kennedy tried 'Fill' to item 'Chip Pouch'(#397058)
[00:57:38]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'drop' to item 'Bones'(#1085600)
[00:57:39]	[ME] 'Verstand': collects the few that are scattered on the ground.
[00:57:40]	'Verstand' tried 'take' to item 'Blight'(#1082836)
[00:57:44]	Harper Kennedy tried 'take' to item 'Corrupted Water'(#1085561)
[00:57:44]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: Stupid people are the norm I guess.
[00:57:45]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: begins handing over the vials, one by one.
[00:57:47]	Kaz Ancrath tried 'drop' to item 'Blight'(#1070941)
[00:57:48]	Kaz Ancrath tried 'drop' to item 'Blight'(#1059717)
[00:57:49]	Kaz Ancrath tried 'drop' to item 'Blight'(#1077675)
[00:57:51]	Kaz Ancrath tried 'drop' to item 'Blight'(#1085585)
[00:57:52]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Yes. *Unfortunately.*
[00:57:52]	Kaz Ancrath tried 'drop' to item 'Blight'(#1085577)
[00:57:57]	[IC] 'Verstand': Err, yes? Five, four.. I think, three two.. One? I forgot. I was too busy thinking about how to be a Wizard..
[00:57:59]	'Verstand' tried 'take' to item 'Blight'(#1059717)
[00:58:00]	'Verstand' tried 'take' to item 'Blight'(#1085585)

[00:58:02]	'Verstand' tried 'take' to item 'Blight'(#1085577)
[00:58:05]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: I apprecaite the fact you appreciate me... Appreciation is hard to come by 'round here.
[00:58:07]	Harper Kennedy tried 'Water' to item 'Monstrous Plant'(#569319)
[00:58:11]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: No matter what ya' do.
[00:58:15]	Harper Kennedy tried 'take' to item 'Chip'(#1085604)
[00:58:18]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: Anyway my point is there is no such thing as a wizard and whatever Kaz does probably has an explanation.
[00:58:19]	Harper Kennedy tried 'take' to item 'Empty Water Bottle'(#1085608)
[00:58:26]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Not easily, the closest thing to an actual wizard here is probably a guy named Long Fellow. 
[00:58:26]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson:  Well uh...mind if I accompany you where ever you may go? Gotta' scavenge and nothing is in the city worthwhile, so.
[00:58:30]	[IC] 'Verstand': Thank you! I shall.. I wanna learn, Wizard. I don't know what voo-doo I need to do, but-...
[00:58:41]	[ME] Markus Wilder: nods.
[00:58:41]	[IC] Monika Brandt: I'm not really going anywhere in particular.
[00:58:41]	[IC] 'Verstand': Does he have a beard..?
[00:58:41]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: He's old and even has a beard, he can talk in your mind and do some other, mind tricks. 
[00:58:54]	[ME] Alexandria Pierson: shrugged, "Better to have company."
[00:58:55]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Especially helping out folks like you do. I'm sure folks take advantage.
[00:59:05]	[RADIO] Kaz Ancrath: Is the cube selling guy still around? Got a bit sidetracked. 
[00:59:06]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Well. Wherever you want to go. As long as it's not the meat thing.
[00:59:08]	[IC] 'Verstand': Woah..
[00:59:15]	[IC] 'Verstand': You his apprentice?
[00:59:22]	[IC] 'Verstand': Can I be the Apprentice's apprentice?
[00:59:34]	Monika Brandt tried 'EquipUn' to item 'P08 Luger'(#725071)
[00:59:35]	Monika Brandt tried 'Equip' to item 'MP5SD'(#725227)
[00:59:37]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Nooo, im no one's apprentice.
[00:59:43]	[ME] Nancy Buchanan: reached up and rubbed at her face, then her eyes. She adjusted her glasses afterwards.
[00:59:52]	[IC] 'Verstand': Oh, so where'd you.. Get that orb?
[00:59:56]	Kaz Ancrath tried 'drop' to item 'Depressants'(#1085586)
[00:59:57]	[IC] 'Verstand': Can I get one in my chest?
[01:00:08]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: I killed a monster and this was its core. 
[01:00:18]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: Yeah, let's not go to that shit...I think I'll get some sort of sinus infection...or just die. Either one. Um...we can go to my place and you can tell me about what's wrong or we can just travel the wastes and beat the shit outta' things.
[01:00:20]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: I havent seen another one of the species so it may have been one of a kind.
[01:00:27]	[IC] 'Verstand': Oh, well then..
[01:00:28]	[ME] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: would speak slightly faster in a short rant, "Yes... Especially when you jump in front of a creature's giant tendrils and it sucks you into it, feelin' your entire body contort and rend itself to shreds... Not even a /thanks/ or are /you okay/... nope."
[01:00:33]	Kaz Ancrath tried 'Sacrifice' to item 'Sacrificial Skull'(#536922)
[01:00:34]	Kaz Ancrath tried 'Sacrifice' to item 'Sacrificial Skull'(#1057313)
[01:00:36]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: It's up to ya.
[01:00:40]	[IC] 'Verstand': If you ever kill one, let me know, please! I'd.. I wanna be cool too!
[01:00:47]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Fucking messed up, man.
[01:00:48]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Mhm, how about this actually. 
[01:00:52]	[IC] Markus Wilder: *Are you* okay?
[01:00:53]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Your place sounds fine. I am not much of a fan of beating things up. I'm more of a gun person, and I prefer not to waste ammo.
[01:01:05]	[IC] 'Verstand': Hm?
[01:01:12]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: I cant teach you...blood magic because its not learnt, but i can teach you void magic, glyphs and the like.
[01:01:12]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: I see. I'm a gun person too, though no ammo, so...
[01:01:13]	Kaz Ancrath used a sacrifical skull: "16"
[01:01:14]	Kaz Ancrath used a sacrifical skull: "28"
[01:01:56]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Indeed.
[01:02:06]	[ME] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: would look towards him as he begins to sit down as if there was a chair beneath him, as he sits a white ooze coming from his boot forms a sort of stool underneath to catch him. Rhert would adjust himself comfortably and look back towards the two, "Make the best of anythin'."
[01:02:13]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: So, let's go then. Follow me, I guess
[01:02:18]	[LOOC] Alexandria Pierson: .*
[01:02:22]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Before i even show you a glyph though, you have to train your mind. When you can reliably and consistently control tier...two aberrated items, then maybe i'll start teaching you eh? Otherwise the effects are way too dangerous and unpredictable.
[01:02:23]	[ME] 'Verstand': grinned ear-to-ear, their eyes, you could probably see a small fire spark in them, in their soul. "Oh, deal! I- Yes! Finally! Something to do! Someone to learn by! Some.. Some magic! I knew it, there's something to do other than cry alone! Oh thank you!" They said, at the top of their lungs, tears of joy streaming down their cheeks.
[01:02:34]	[ME] Markus Wilder: nods.
[01:02:38]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: I got an interesting leg out of it.
[01:02:45]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Lead the way.
[01:03:01]	[IC] 'Verstand': Sure! Yes! I-.. Whatever I must do, I'll do it! P-Push ups? I can do like.. Five! I'll make.. Make ten! Whatever it is!
[01:03:07]	Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies tried 'Equip' to item 'Riotshield'(#1008713)
[01:03:07]	[ME] Kaz Ancrath: raises a brow, a look of doubt flashing over his features. "Riiight, the mental training is on you though." 
[01:03:32]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Kinda jealous, looks fun.
[01:03:40]	[IC] 'Verstand': I can.. I can do that. I'll read the bible more, I feel something.. Calming about it. But seriously, ooh thank you for existing..
[01:03:41]	[IC] Kaz Ancrath: Nope, muscles wont help you here, meditate alot more, find your like, zen? I Guess. And supplement that with *endurance* running. 
[01:03:45]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: It's kinda fun to mess around with.
[01:03:46]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: You can always cut your leg off. 
[01:03:51]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: Oh, christ.
[01:03:55]	[IC] Alexandria Pierson: So...been here long?
[01:03:58]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Yes.
[01:04:00]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Sadly.

[03:00:15]	[IC] Milo Martin: Looked like rape to me.
[03:00:22]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: It's not real dude.
[03:00:29]	[RADIO] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: They left on their own.
[03:00:29]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: I got them from a sweat shop.
[03:00:29]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: No one got kicked out onto the street. And if you want to be technical, there is no street nearby anyway.
[03:00:50]	[RADIO] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Also apparently a blind person was being held down.
[03:00:57]	[IC] Milo Martin: *Deaf*.
[03:00:58]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Rhert, do you like Nancy? Like, as more than a friend?
[03:01:04]	[IC] George Nishimura: I know a couple of sweat shops, but not the type you're probably talking about.
[03:01:09]	[RADIO] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Sorry, deaf.

[03:02:27]	[IC] Milo Martin: Even if they were, not much you could do about it.
[03:02:28]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: This is a wholesome community where nobody complaines.
[03:02:32]	[ME] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: would look towards him with a slight smile on his face, "Nah, she is a good friend."
[03:02:34]	[IC] Milo Martin: Go against the grain here and your head will end up on a stick.

[03:02:55]	[IC] George Nishimura: REFRAIN these advances or I will SUE-- Everything's fine, man-with-glowing-hand. My psuedo-children and I are just out and about.

[03:04:25]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: They get mad when you tell them to die, so it kinda ruined my vibe with 'em.

[03:07:34]	[IC] George Nishimura: They're all having sex with crusader man in that brick warehouse if I recall incorrectly.
[03:07:41]	[IC] Milo Martin: Yeah. I'd do things if I could, but I don't have any metal scrap, and I have to wait five days until I can get slightly stronger.
[03:07:54]	[IC] George Nishimura: You need scrap?
[03:07:59]	[IC] Milo Martin: Uhhh.
[03:08:01]	[IC] Milo Martin: Sure, I guess.

[03:08:52]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: I see... Yeah, for some reason it takes a long time to get better and anything now.
[03:09:08]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: It's almost like, we just forgot how to hit the gym.
[03:09:26]	[IC] Milo Martin: All I consume is plain rice and skinless chicken breast.
[03:09:29]	[IC] Milo Martin: Yet I still make no gains.
[03:09:32]	[IC] George Nishimura: I don't need to get stronger if I can just run away from situations.
[03:09:39]	[ME] Markus Wilder: just sighs, looking over at them as he says "Can probably let her go now, maybe clean up a little.''
[03:09:42]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: You could get faster.

[03:10:39]	[ME] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: would look at the room in a pretty awkward silence as he closes one his left eye, his only good one left, to look over the room taking mental notes on where any ichor would be on them. He would then open his other eye before letting out a slight sigh and looking down towards his boots, "Yeah... Just gonna' wait til' she comes to." He would then gently lift her and remove his coat before bundling it up and going back to rubbing her back. 
[03:10:52]	[IC] Natalya Castelle: Get paid get laid gatorade.
[03:10:52]	[IC] George Nishimura: I have chicken legs, friend.

[03:11:19]	[IC] George Nishimura: It's okay, I've been in a coma for a while.
[03:11:21]	[IC] Milo Martin: Yeah, getting faster is on the list. But you gotta get tougher so you can run longer distances first.
[03:11:46]	[W] George Nishimura: I swear to GOD if another monster groans in my ear I'm committing non-consentual sex.
[03:11:52]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: I'm pretty much a walking *unit* at this point so I dont really need to do much.
[03:12:01]	[IC] Milo Martin: Understandable.
[03:12:10]	[W] George Nishimura: I swear to GOD if another monster groans in my ear I'm committing non-consentual sex.

[03:27:05]	[IC] Monika Brandt: I don't know what it's saying, but --
[03:27:10]	[IC] George Nishimura: I am severely.
[03:27:12]	[IC] George Nishimura: Underequipped.
[03:27:18]	[ME] Nancy Buchanan: exhaled slowly, stopping as she turned around.

[03:27:39]	[Y] George Nishimura: Cut the racket.
[03:27:48]	[ME] Markus Wilder: stands up, closest to the door as he says "Nance, it's me...alright? Just calm down."
[03:27:52]	[IC] Monika Brandt: It's okay. You are going to be fine. Just sit down. Do you want to tell me what it is saying?
[03:28:03]	[MEFAR] 'Brush': shot a thumbs up to all in the room.
[03:28:10]	[ME] Nancy Buchanan: stepped back. "listen I-.. I don't know who you are I-.."

[03:29:02]	[ME] Nancy Buchanan: wiggled the door handle aggressively
[03:29:05]	[RADIO] Monika Brandt: You know chasing her is probably just going to scare her.
[03:29:09]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: I will unlock it just do me a favor.

[03:30:36]	[ME] George Nishimura: turned to his right, blinking.

[03:31:49]	[ME] George Nishimura: shivers.
[03:31:56]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Wha-...No!

[03:32:08]	[ME] Nancy Buchanan: exhaled, moving out the door quickly without a word
[03:32:18]	[IC] George Nishimura: Where are my clothes..?
[03:32:28]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Just wait a moment, and then I will go out and track her and watch her to make sure she doesn't die.
[03:32:28]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: *Fuck* where-..
[03:32:32]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Simple.
[03:32:34]	[IC] Markus Wilder: She can't remember *us*! What else can't she remember, did any of you think of that?
[03:32:40]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Yes. I did.
[03:32:40]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Let me know if she shows up again.

[03:32:53]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Thanks
[03:32:59]	[IC] Markus Wilder: Fucking hell.

[03:33:16]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Excuse me. I'm going to go try and keep my distance from her.
[03:33:23]	[ME] Markus Wilder: just turns and punches the concrete wall, cradling his hand after as he says "FUCK THAT HURT!"
[03:33:32]	[IC] George Nishimura: Is there anywhere here that isn't ultra-depressing?
[03:33:33]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Mmm. Concrete tends to do that.

[03:33:48]	[IC] Milo Martin: Actually, there's plenty of places that aren't ultra-depressing.
[03:33:49]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: She will be okay.

[03:34:33]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Did I say *everyone leave?* If she sees a bunch of gun-toting people chasing her across the land, she'll panic.
[03:34:35]	[IC] Milo Martin: They can get annoying.

[03:43:58]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: He's trying to make you question me.
[03:44:01]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: To make you go with him.
[03:44:02]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Which I am not stupid enough to do, therefore I know nothing.

[03:44:09]	[ME] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: would turn around and walk towards the table since he no longer has chairs he can spawn in. He would sit up onto the table and pat the area next to him. "I will tell you /everything/ I know."
[03:44:11]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: So he can kidnapp me again?
[03:44:13]	[ME] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: scoffs again, visibly somewhat amused by this. "What use would I have with her?"
[03:44:19]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: You want to rape her.
[03:44:21]	[ME] Monika Brandt: sits on the edge of the other table.
[03:44:25]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: That's why you were all in that room.
[03:44:25]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: You're pathetic.
[03:44:35]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: And you're disgusting.
[03:44:42]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: That's what you want to resort to?
[03:44:47]	Milo Martin tried '_use' to item 'Antibiotics'(#1083549)
[03:45:04]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: You're a petty little shade, with a thirst for power, trying to cause ripples.
[03:45:13]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: I'm no Shade, Glenn.
[03:45:20]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Is that so?
[03:45:28]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: I've evolved beyond Shades and Drifters.
[03:45:48]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Just about as vague as what any other *evolved* being says.
[03:45:51]	[IT] Epicmarkvent: He'd wave his hand and the portal would reopen.
[03:46:16]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: Exactly.
[03:46:18]	[IC] George Nishimura: I have nothing. I can build nothing.
[03:46:22]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: Because this isn't meant for you, Glenn.
[03:46:23]	[IC] George Nishimura: My disappointment is immeasurable.
[03:46:25]	[IC] Milo Martin: Welcome to my life.
[03:46:26]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: Go back where you came from.
[03:46:42]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Why, so you can manipulate her to do your will?
[03:46:46]	Milo Martin purchased the door
[03:46:59]	Milo Martin purchased the door
[03:47:04]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: If I wanted that, I'd have done it. 
[03:47:06]	[IC] George Nishimura: It's cold.
[03:47:11]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Funny, how Nancy is the one targated again and again...
[03:47:11]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: So many opportunities.
[03:47:24]	[IC] Glenn 'White Lung' Boyd: Always seems to be the center of some unlucky bullshit.
[03:47:24]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: In the previous Respite there was a group called Malestar or Malestare or somethin' like that... They had some higher tier tech able to do things like regenerate body parts, limbs, increase your muscle, allow you to see in the dark and whatever. Fane during a mission was shot in the head trying to help the Malestars and eventually they picked him up and patched him up. He lost quite a bit of memory but he is slowly gainin' it back. Now... There was a person that used to work there that did some type of experiment on Nancy's head. He now gives her commands whenver and she has to follow them.
[03:47:41]	[IC] George Nishimura: Be right back.
[03:47:42]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: You're not wrong.
[03:47:48]	[LEV] Animus: *A loud, fleshy crash is heard outside*
[03:47:55]	[IC] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: Of course...
[03:47:59]	[ME] Monika Brandt: nods very slowly, even more slowly than she normally nods. She then jumps up from the table.

[03:55:43]	[IC] Monika Brandt: I was just saying I hope I don't get an eye shot out.

[03:56:29]	[ME] Nancy Buchanan: looked down at herself, seeming to pat at her vest. She opened a pocket, furrowing her brow, as she pulled out a locket Rhert had mentioned earlier. She replaced it back inside, looking between the two of them.
[03:56:35]	[IC] Nancy Buchanan: Okay Listen I-.. wh-what is happening?
[03:56:37]	[IC] Monika Brandt: No depth perception, reduced peripheral vision, reduced field of view in general.
[03:56:44]	[IC] Monika Brandt: If it's the wrong eye, then using firearms is harder.
[03:56:45]	[IC] Monika Brandt: Uh...
[03:56:46]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: I will explain it all once I am rid of him.
[03:56:50]	[IC] Monika Brandt: No, not worth it at all.
[03:57:08]	[IC] Monika Brandt: The human body evolved the way it did for a good reason. I prefer to keep mine as close as possible to its default state.

[03:57:13]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: No.
[03:57:27]	[IC] Epicmarkvent: I have no desire to harm him.
[03:57:34]	[ME] Rhert 'Ten' Voorhies: would lean down as he looks closer at the creature and sighs looking at its wounds specifically to see what may have killed it.
