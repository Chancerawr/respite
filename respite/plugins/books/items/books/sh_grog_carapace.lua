	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	The Carapace Bug is an insectoid creature that is the final phase of a Carapace Spawn’s development.  The bug is approximately the same size as an adult female human and weighs approximately 250 pounds. It has four legs, two hind and two fore, and usually uses its rear legs to propel itself and its forward legs to swipe away obstacles or attack prey.  The rear legs are larger than the forelegs in order to give it better mobility in muddy or soft terrain, while the forelegs are serrated and spear-like in order to allow it to burrow or climb to a given position.  These legs are attached to a torso that is approximately the same size of that of a canine, but the size of the creature comes from the hardened mantle protects most of its body.  The mantle is shaped like a pike at the front, with approximately a dozen slits to allow the creature to look outward.  On all other sides of the mantle there fluted slits similar to a fish’s gills that enable the Carapace Bug to listen for prey with its keen sense of hearing.
<br/><br/>
	The Carapace Bug will often use its appendages to dig underground or bury itself to wait for its prey.  Its coloration, often brown or some shade of green, is used to help it blend into the environment.  When a bug sees, feels, or most often hears the sounds of potential prey nearby, it may rapidly emerge from its hiding spot to use an appendage like a spear and secure its enemy.
<br/><br/>
	When submerged or simply not on the hunt, the creature rests in a burrow it creates.  The Carapace Bug can reside underwater and takes advantage of the water or even moisture in the air or ground to harden its shell.  On the torso of the bug are six additional panels to the mantle that are always hardened, like bone. These panels cover two of the twelve intake membranes that a Carapace Bug uses to maintain its body density.  When dehydrated, the Carapace Bug’s mantle becomes brittle and may crack like a chapped lip.  As a result, these creatures are most active in cool, dark environments.  Their ability to regulate their temperatures is rather weak however, so at times they may move into the sun to warm up.  This weakness also ensures that they are rarely found in desert or snowy terrain, though in some cases they may take up residence near hot springs, geysers, or an oasis.

	<b>INTERACTIONS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	The serrated forelegs of the Carapace Bug may cause substantial bleeding if the creature gets a solid slash or penetration, similar to a shark bite.  It is known to ‘guillotine’ prey that it has skewered but first skewering them on one foreleg, stabilizing itself on its hind legs, and then finishing the prey off with a slash from it is other leg.  This attack is incredibly lethal, but presents an opportunity for those who may be aiding the victim to fire on the weak underbelly of the bug.  If the underbelly is not a viable target, the limbs may be the most ideal one.  Unlike the Carapace Thrall, a mature Carapace Bug cannot readily replenish itself with maggot armor, and damage is far more critical.  Severely wounding a Carapace Bug is also a handy way to force it to retreat, as they have a strong sense of self-preservation.  
<br/><br/>
	One of the best tactics devised to combat Carapace Bugs emerged from Tarot Defense Forces engaged in extermination routines.  While the bugs can breathe underwater through a sort of gill, they can also survive above ground and breathe through those same gills.  TDF exterminators found that the bugs could be easily dispatched in confined spaces by filling a room with flammable gas and igniting that gas.  This would often cause the creatures to burn from the inside out, given that their mantles are fairly resistant to fire.  If no gas is available, sealing the creatures into a room with sufficient oxygen and setting a fire in that room will cause them to asphyxiate.  These tactics were later adapted by Tarot’s Ordnance Department with some assistance from a small group of Sand Shark researchers and a machinist shade from the Cald  to develop several small-arms platforms capable of firing compressed, flammable gases that could be ignited to cause fires or explosions.  To date, these are some of the most effective tools for clearing out hives of these creatures.  Of course, a flamethrower or Molotov cocktail is also ideal.

	<b>USES:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Despite the fact that some people have reservations, the large hind legs of the Carapace Bug are filled with a tender flesh with a similar consistency to crab meat.  They are frequently cut off, stripped of their shell, cleaned, and then cut up into cubes to be steamed and served in a soup or chowder.  Some hunters with a dark sense of humor invented “Cara-Kebabs”.  This dish takes a long rectangle of the flesh and skewers it on the long side similar to a battered hotdog.  The skewer is roasted over a fire or fried, and is then eaten by having the diner use their knife to “guillotine” off smaller chunks of the flesh.  
<br/><br/>
	While the Mantle of the Carapace Bug may seem like a hardy armor plate, it quickly becomes brittle after the death of the wearer.  However, this design has inspired various smiths over the years to develop metal weaponry and armor that replicates its appendages and mantle in their designs.
