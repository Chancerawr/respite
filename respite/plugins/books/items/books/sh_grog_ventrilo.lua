	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Ventriloquists are largely docile creatures with soft and tender flesh, similar to that of a fish.  They are surprisingly intelligent and can communicate with one another to warn of approaching threats.  They can be tamed, and some have been genetically engineered by the Sand Shark faction for deployment in combat zones.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>UNMODIFIED CHARACTERISTICS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	The ventriloquists found in the wild are fairly undeserving of their names.  They have bloated stomachs that make them fairly sluggish and unresponsive in behavior. This sluggish nature disappears in the presence of a threat, but in almost all other cases the ventriloquist will feed upon a meal of least resistance, usually carrion or vegetation.  
<br/><br/>
	The ventriloquists are somewhat humanoid in nature, having both two arms and two hands.  Due to the weight of their torsos however, it is believed that they lack the balance necessary to remain upright at all times.  
<br/><br/>
	In order to sense danger, the ‘sac’ of the ventriloquist sends forth usually a single tendril that has a hole in it for the intake and expulsion of gas.  This tendril has a direct tie to their olfactory nerves and enables the species to detect possible prey (given the pungent stench of rot) or predators.  An additional three tendrils are held in reserve within the creature should it find itself in exceptional danger.  That being said, even if a tendril is cut or destroyed it will likely grow back within 72 hours.  The maturity of the creature determines the rate of growth. 
<br/><br/>
	Should the ventriloquist be threatened, the tendril may expunge a thick cloud of sulfur in order to enable it to retreat.  It is believed that this gas is built up over time in the chest of the creature, likely coming from some of its food waste.
<br/><br/>
	It is believed that these creatures are gendered, but their means of reproduction are unknown.
<br/><br/>
	<b>GENETIC MODIFICATIONS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	There are two key modifications that humans have made to the ventriloquists in the domestication process.
<br/><br/>
	Tarot farmers are known to have specifically nurtured Ventriloquists for use in various domestic dishes.  A popular dish within certain eateries is known as ‘Ventriloquist Calamari’, where the tendril is cut in a fashion similar to the tentacles of a squid or octopus, battered, and fried in vegetable oil.  The soft texture of the flesh of the ventriloquist and its ability to rapidly regrow its tendrils makes it an ideal source of food.  These livestock versions of domesticated ventriloquists are highly sought after creatures however, as their cautious nature makes them difficult to capture and stress or pain can hinder their ability to regenerate a tender limb. Expert farmers of this ‘cattle stock’ have learned to mix sedatives in the creatures food, while also keeping them in a secluded, yet open-air environment.  
<br/><br/>
	Researchers with the Sand Sharks, in conjunction with the Cald, were able to develop a modification for the ventriloquists that earned them their name.  With assistance from the shade known as Calderon, the sulfur repositories within the creatures were replaced with a regenerating cloud of grey gas that is expunged through the tendrils to resurrect nearby corpses as a method of defense.  These tendrils act like the strings of a marionette, guiding the corpse to take actions that protect the ventriloquist involved.  In order to mitigate the vulnerability of these creatures, testing with carcinogel was performed to develop a sort of carapace that covers the tender backside of the creatures.  A similar chitin-construct was developed to protect their skulls, ensuring that they could watch their puppets as they were manipulated.  Ventriloquists led by a human or plastic handler are known to be rather effective at pest-control activities, as the creatures can control up to four of the deceased pests at once to attack others.  In a fashion similar to ‘Empties’, these combat ventriloquists can display an exponential increase in combat ability over the course of a fight.  Increases in casualties for the opposing side serve the ventriloquist by giving them a larger stock of potential puppets to choose from, or fresh, largely undamaged ones.
