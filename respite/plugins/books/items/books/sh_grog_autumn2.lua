		In a place that does not change.
	<br/><br/>
		What does not live cannot die.
	<br/><br/>
		We do not live here, for we exist wholly elsewhere.
	<br/><br/>
		Therefore, we cannot truly die.
	<br/><br/>
		Death here does not end anything but a chance.
	<br/><br/>
		A chance for a normal life, in another life.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		I remember death fondly.
	<br/><br/>
		Window open.
	<br/><br/>
		That late September air.
	<br/><br/>
		Leaves are green still, but slowly decay ensnares them.
	<br/><br/>
		A blight.
	<br/><br/>
		A blight of brown, dead cells.
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		The beauty of autumn comes not from what it is.
	<br/><br/>
		But what it was.
	<br/><br/>
		What it will be.
	<br/><br/>
		The birth of spring, the flourish of summer.  
	<br/><br/>
		Autumn ends that, but produces the means for it to happen once more.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		I remember the crisp apples.  Cider.
	<br/><br/>
		The smell of fresh cut hay.
	<br/><br/>
		Cold rains.
	<br/><br/>
		Here, there is no autumn.
	<br/><br/>
		For there is no cycle.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		Time does not truly pass here.
	<br/><br/>
		We measure it, but the world does not react to time.
	<br/><br/>
		I do not age. 
	<br/><br/>
		The trees and rocks do not age.
	<br/><br/>
		Therefore, there is no autumn.
	<br/><br/>
		Here, we only have an impure facsimile.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		Here, there is no birth and death for those who call themselves human.
	<br/><br/>
		We bury.
	<br/><br/>
		We mourn.
	<br/><br/>
		But out there is something more.
	<br/><br/>
		Here, decay is not a new beginning.
	<br/><br/>
		It is an escape.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		We live instead in a perpetual state of decay.
	<br/><br/>
		A state of autumn.
	<br/><br/>
		One without appreciation.
	<br/><br/>
		What decays here never lived in the first place.
	<br/><br/>
		And therefore this place is devoid of meaning.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		This is our autumn.
	<br/><br/>
		And how pitiful it is.
