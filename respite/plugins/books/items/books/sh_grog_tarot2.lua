	<b>THE NINETEEN SEATS:</b>
<br/><br/>	
	<i>The Lovers – Hedonis, Hedonna</i>
<br/><br/>	
	We begin looking at the Nineteen Seats with the Lovers because they are the only seat in the entire Tarot system that is held by multiple shades concurrently.  The powers of these shades are split between two equal parties, traditionally one male and one female.  Additionally, these shades choose their own names and are not forced to adopt the name of the seat individually.  Collectively however they are deemed “The Lovers”.  Despite the seat’s name, these parties need not be in a romantic relationship with one another.  They represent temptation however, and oversee the faction’s “Bread and Circus”.  Together, these two manage the various entertainment districts of Tarots principalities, along with any competitive events that may occur outside of Tarot territories.  In recent decades these events have come to include various athletic events, bloodsports, and vehicle races.  The current male, whose chosen name is Hedonis, has served for an unknown period of time.  He has adopted the responsibilities of management and oversight (sales, bookmaking, accounts, etc.), though his fondness for races will frequently make him the officiator of such events.  For nearly all over events, Hedonna serves as the mistress of ceremonies and frequently handles the role of announcer as well.  We believe that she is one of, if not the youngest of the Tarots at only thirty years of tenure.  
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Fool – Le Mat (French?)</i>
<br/><br/>
	We look at The Fool card second as they are the only seat who is not required to come from the Tarot general population.  In fact, the individual that holds this seat is not directly related to the other shades in any form of Asherian kinship (brother, father, etc.) and often comes from another faction.  Appointees are selected by The World, approved by the Senate, and may be impeached or dismissed from their position by the Senate or Devil.  In times of old, this position was used as a diplomatic tool in order to curry favor with other factions. This status made this position have a high turnover, so the specific number of “Fools” that have existed is unknown.  In recent years this ambiguity has not been cleared up, as the role has transitioned to more of a ‘spymaster’ role.  The party that fills this seat often has very little known about them besides their nationality (determined by their name), though there are times where this seat will have its name changed in order to obscure the identity of the party that holds it.  This secretive nature is so extensive that The Fool is the only seat permitted to obscure their appearance during emergency meetings, and who can send an envoy in their place to general meetings.  The current Fool, Le Mat, has expressed a fondness for sending plastics as his envoys, and he tends to select different ones each time.
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Magician – Gandalf (?)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The only exceptional rule of this seat is that the holder traditionally selects a legendary wizard, warlock, or witch from their own culture to serve as their name. This seat traditionally oversees health services, and also acts as the designated medical professional for all other seats.  We are aware that the name of the current seat-holder sounds silly, and Samraat stated that Diavola elected to put his name up to a public vote at the magician-heir’s own request.  Such is the power of democracy.
<br/><br/>
	<i>High Priestess – Pretresse (French)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The High Priestess seat oversees the education and health of minors within Tarot, along with those suffering from various developmental disabilities.  This seat is traditionally only held by women, and is colloquially referred to as “Mother”.  
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Empress – Empress (English)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The Empress oversees agricultural affairs within Tarot, including the importation and exportation of agricultural goods.  She also oversees emergency stores and humanitarian aid.  This seat is traditionally only held by women, though a male was designated as Empress 2 due to a romantic relationship he had with Empress 1, and his successor was also male because “women can not farm for shit and are better suited to churning the butter”.  
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Hierophant – Hierophant (English)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The Hierophant frequently serves as a diplomatic and military aid to the Emperor, and is frequently responsible for directly advising him or briefing him on various matters.  As a formality, he organizes religious events for those who wish to recognize human-theologies.  While the nationality of the Hierophant is currently unknown (they merely adopted the name as a convenience it seems), there are rumors that he is of Japanese descent and is actually rather adept in combat, wielding an attack that cannot be stopped.
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Chariot – Centurion (?)</i>
<br/><br/>
	Again, we are unaware of the nationality of this figure.  In recent years the Chariot has moved away from his original job of serving as a logistics coordinator for the faction to serving as the head of military matters for the faction.  For purposes of security, only the gender of this figure is known (male).  We do know however from his frequent appearances as a competitor in motorsport events that he is an adept racer.  
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Hermit – Ermitano (Spanish)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The hermit presides over historical documents and writings in Tarot.  He manages the faction’s libraries and all tomes of knowledge that do not pertain to matters of military intelligence.  He has also emerged as administrative council to various government agencies whose efforts focus on research.
<br/><br/>
	<i>Wheel of Fortune – Vacant</i>
<br/><br/>
	This seat was changed approximately twenty years ago from a “vice-Devil” (to assume powers in the event that the Devil is incapacitated or killed without an heir) to encompass logistics operations due to changes in The Chariot seat. However, the creation of a government agency to oversee those operations and the obnoxious nature of comments about the name of the seat due to a popular television show has made this seat remain vacant.  The extremely long tenure of Diavola has made many believe that this role is entirely redundant.
<br/><br/>
	<i>Strength – Qiangdu (Chinese)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The Strength seat accompanies The Chariot seat in that it is also traditionally focused on military affairs. Strength, however, looks specifically away from faction-faction conflict and focuses more on environmental threats, specifically the threats posed by ‘bleeders’.  Qiangdu’s current role is to not only dispatch teams to eliminate incredibly potent ‘bleeders’, but she is also responsible for developing strategies to counter various mutations or populations of more common bleeders.
<br/><br/>
	<i>Hanged Man – Hanged Man (English)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The Hanged Man leads the Hanged Men, the special-forces division of Tarot’s military.  He manages the unit’s logistics, training, and overall strategy, and he may act with relative autonomy over The Chariot.  This seat does traditionally work closely with Strength and Chariot however, due to their interconnected roles.  
<br/><br/>
	<i>Death – Dood (Afrikaans)</i>
<br/><br/>
	Death oversees imprisonment and executions for the Tarot. Traditionally their identity is obscured in order to prevent them from being widely vilified by the population in a manner similar to how medieval executioners would wear hoods.  
<br/><br/>
	<i>Temperance – Temperance (Seat-holder is of Persian descent)</i>
<br/><br/>
	Temperance was once tasked with being the seat responsible for matters of piety, but has shifted towards policing.  Temperance is tasked with overseeing municipal law enforcement.  
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Tower – Turm (German)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The Tower focuses on the defense of Tarot territories, specifically on the maintenance of civil militias and fortifications.  We know that the current seat holder is somewhat controversial, and had some particular issues with Constantin Durand of the Sand Sharks, though the specifics are unknown.  His controversy extends to other shades within the Tarot ranks, including Justitie, Centurion, the Hanged Man, Zvezda, and reportedly even Le Mat.
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Star – Zvezda (Russian)</i>
<br/><br/>
	Star oversees central banking measures of the Tarot economy, particularly matters of monetary and financial policy, along with the printing of currency.  The current Star is rather hawkish, and focuses heavily on inflation controls in order to curb the devaluation of their domestic currency.  Historically, the Tarot’s currency has appreciated heavily against scrap coins due to the reckless amount of unregulated printing within that currency.  The current Zvezda also struggles to get along with Turm.
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Moon – La Luna (Spanish)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The Moon’s specific role within the Tarot system is largely unknown, besides the fact that we know they deal with economic matters.  Intelligence reports indicate that she is responsible for accounting for “unofficial” transactions, specifically referring to off-the-books economic activity.  This can range from tax-avoidance to smuggling, but we believe that she is actually responsible for facilitating the latter.  In particular she deals with smuggling goods to bypass trade restrictions put forth by other factions.
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Sun – Ghrian (Gaelic)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The Sun oversees trade and finance in the faction.  They handle diplomacy and regulations on the importation and exportation of various goods and commodities, save for agricultural products.  They also supervise moneylending and the faction’s commercial banking system.
<br/><br/>
	<i>Judgement – Judgement (English)</i>
<br/><br/>
	Judgement works closely with the Empress, Tower, and Temperance seats to respond to domestic disasters. This includes, but is not limited to, earthquakes, storms, infestations, disease outbreaks, and failures in the utilities system.  
<br/><br/>
	<i>The World – Shijie</i>
<br/><br/>
	The World seat oversees military intelligence. They are responsible for identifying appointees for The Fool seat on top of gathering intelligence about both allied and opposed factions.
