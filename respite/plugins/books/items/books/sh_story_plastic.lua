The “Plastic Beings”, more commonly called “Plastics” by most speaking lifeforms, are one of the most common creatures in the Void. Their numbers likely far exceed those of Aberrations, and some believe they may even exceed those of Abominations. Though this is somewhat disputed, as there is no actual way of knowing how many Plastics or Abominations exist at any one time. This data is extrapolated from how many of the creatures have been encountered by reporting Drifters throughout time. This means it is unlikely to incorporate Plastics in distant or closed off Respites. 
<br/><br/>
Plastics, as their name implies, are made completely, or at least are majorly composed, of Plastic. They come in a variety of forms, such as animals, plants, fish, but the most common is the humanoid form. Such Plastics have all of the same organs as human beings, but they seemingly do nothing. There is no blood or air circulating through a plastic, nor any refuse. Also notable is the lack of most sexual organs. This is attributed to the method through which Plastics reproduce, which will be covered later in this report. However, there does seem to be a “gender” for Plastics, as some Plastics appear to have a female form, while others have a male one. The reason for this is likely the same reason that their bodies contain seemingly functionless organs. It is possibly because their bodies copy those of Drifters, but mostly in appearance.
<br/><br/>
Since the creatures are made of Plastic, their bodies are generally more frail, and more easily broken than a Drifter’s is. However, this also comes with the benefits of electrical resistance, and the ability to survive in areas with toxic airborne substances. They seemingly do not even need to breathe, and can spend time underwater if they wish. They are however, not immune to Blue Haze. The reason for this has yet to be determined. However, Plastics do feel pain, and can feel differences in temperature. They can also see, hear, and smell, even if their eyes do not move, or their ears are very simple. Plastics that lack these senses also appear to be completely missing the organ for that sense. For example, a Plastic with nothing representing eyes will be completely blind.
<br/><br/>
Plastics still require food and drink just as humans do. However, since many do not have mouths, they have a rather peculiar way of eating. They simply bring the food or drink up to where their mouth would be if they had one, and it simply disappears. The substances seemingly teleport right into their bodies, and then travel through them like it would if they were a human being. Through this method Plastics can even bite people, as if they had some sort of invisible mouth. However, it is not very effective in combat, and does not seem to inflict much damage, and in many cases it does less damage than a regular human bite.
<br/><br/>
Since Plastics lack sexual organs, they do not feel emotions such as romantic love, and most will have no urge to seek a partner for any reason other than platonic friendship. In rare and strange cases where a Drifter has pursued a romantic relationship with a Plastic, results have been somewhat unexpected. Upon attempting to kiss the Plastic in a romantic way, the skin on a Drifter’s face was completely converted to Plastic. More severe cases are not mentioned here due to their incredibly disturbing nature. It is best advised to completely avoid attempting romance with a Plastic of any sort.
<br/><br/>
While the organs of Plastics seemingly do nothing, destruction of said organs will cause a Plastic severe issues just as it would a human. Alongside this, open wounds on a Plastic will eventually result in death as if they had bled out, even though they do not have blood. The time it takes for this to occur is roughly about the same time it takes for a human with a similar injury. 
<br/><br/>
It is also important to note that their bodies cannot heal normally as human bodies do. Missing material must be replaced with actual plastic. For cuts or puncture wounds, Plastic Dust is generally required alongside water. They simply need to pack the wound with the material, cover it sufficiently in water (corrupted or otherwise), and wait about a day or so for it to be completely stable. A recently mended Plastic will likely have the best outcome if they refrain from physical exertion for at least a day, otherwise they risk reopening their wounds or possibly worsening them.
<br/><br/>
Plastics can also use this method of treatment for replacing limbs. If they take a detached limb from themselves or another Plastic, they can attach it to a missing stump by applying moistened Plastic Dust to both sides of the limb. This can have mixed results depending on the quality of the limb being added, and some Plastics find this to be crude, and thus avoid the procedure. Nonetheless, it can be a necessary treatment option in trying times.
<br/><br/>
The immense number of Plastics and Plastic settlements results in a massive variety of different Plastic cultures and belief systems. However, there are still many constants. All Plastics share the same written and sign language, which every Plastic knows from the moment of their creation. Another constant is the perceived holiness of the Shard. Plastics can often be seen worshipping shards wherever they find them, often constructing small shrines, or giving offerings to the shard. Some cultures have been seen to even perform sacrifices to shards. The reason for this is not completely understood. A popular theory is that it is because of the transformation reactions that can take place after a Plastic touches a shard with their bare skin.
<br/><br/>
When a Plastic makes bare physical contact with a shard, one of two things can happen. They either turn into a Fiend, or a Crystalline Plastic. The Fiend is examined closely in its own report, “Fiends of Blood.” Information on Crystalline Plastics can be found in the report, “Crystal Flesh.”
<br/><br/>
It is also important to note that since Plastics groups can have many differing beliefs and cultures, they can also conflict at times. Plastics are not innately friendly with all other Plastics, and sometimes even wage massive wars against other Plastics. The larger of these wars have been observed to lure in Abominations, creating gruesome battles for all involved. It is best to avoid Respites involved in Plastic warfare.
<br/><br/>
A Plastic can come into existence through a number of ways, the most common is for them to be physically built, generally by another Plastic, or by a Drifter. The amount and quality of the material used can produce different types of Plastics. Below are some fairly consistent results experienced during experimentation. 
<br/><br/>
Dummy Plastic:
<br/>
100 Plastic, 10 Chips
<br/>
A somewhat lackluster form of Plastic, generally used by more cruel Drifters for hard labor purposes. More sophisticated Plastic groups view the creation of these to be quite offensive.
<br/><br/>
Simple Plastic:
<br/>
200 Plastic, 25 Chips
<br/>
This is very similar to the kind of Plastic seen in most areas. It cannot speak, and it is not very strong, but are capable of using tools and tactics just as humans are, can be very dangerous in numbers.
<br/><br/>
Speaking Plastic:
<br/>
300 Plastic, 50 Chips, 1 Blue Haze
<br/>
This Plastic is capable of speaking, which is generally necessary for any kind of role requiring communication. It is also notable that the Plastic itself will not be great at speaking english, and will require time and possibly training before fully mastering the language. Until then, they will speak in simple sentences, likely slowly as well.
<br/><br/>
Our experiments could not proceed further than this due to both resource constraints, and pressure from a nearby colony of Plastics.
<br/><br/>
When a Drifter creates a Plastic, it is almost always loyal to them, and will obey most orders given. This can result in large Plastic colonies headed by a single Drifter leader. This is however, not an infallible link. Large groups of Plastics will revolt against their leader in severe cases, but is still quite rare. In the case of a Plastic creating another Plastic, this link is far weaker, but still somewhat present. Plastics can still for their own colonies if the resources are available, but generally it is far easier for a Drifter. Even so, the majority of Plastics are created by other Plastics, as Drifters are just too few compared to the mass numbers of Plastics throughout the Void.
<br/><br/>
When a Plastic is created, it is in its final growth stage. It will not naturally age any further, and will not die of old age either. The Plastic is granted with an understanding of its creator’s primary language, plastic sign language, and plastic written language. They will also have a basic understanding of the world they reside in, but they will lack advanced or specific knowledge. For example, they will know what an Abomination is, and that it is dangerous, but they will not automatically know any weaknesses, or know about the exact form of the Abomination. The same goes for Respite technologies, such as Refineries, Fishing Poles, Farms, etc. They will generally understand how to use the tools, but not how they work, or how to create them unless they learn.
<br/><br/>
Another method of creating a Plastic is to simply insert chips into one’s Respite Orb. Upon placing enough chips, Plastics will seemingly appear from nothingness in the Drifter’s Respite. These Plastics heed the Drifters commands, just as if they were created by hand. However, these Plastics rarely leave their Drifter’s Respite. Plastics who are urged to do so outright refuse, or plead to not have to. If they are physically taken out of the Respite, they often attempt to escape their Drifter creator, it also appears that they lose most of their innate allegiance as well. It is not recommended to do this unless a Drifter’s Respite has become dangerous or uninhabitable. This often ends up creating a large amount of Plastic refugees, that will likely wander through Respites, just as Drifters do. This is believed to be the source of most of the Plastics encountered in abandoned Respites. If a Drifter dies while Plastics are still in the Drifter’s Respite, they will often remain in their home Respite, but this can prove dangerous due to increases in Abominations and Shades. However, if a Drifter properly trains their Plastics before they meet their end, the Plastics themselves have a much higher survival rate. If a runaway Plastic is returned to the Respite they came from, it will return to normal and will have its loyalty restored. However, if it is taken to a foreign, inhabited Respite, it will not change at all.
