		<font color='black' size='3'>Respite is a survival, horror, and mystery 
		schema where your character is placed in a strange and unfamiliar world 
		filled with monsters, traps, strange anomalies, and other obstacles. 
		<br/><br/>
			
			Large scale events can vary, but they will usually give you some 
		sort of objective, directly or indirectly. While doing this objective you will
		encounter many of the worldâ€™s anomalies, like portals, monsters, automated traps, 
		distortions, etc. There will be subtle hints about the story as you go through. 
		Exploration and examination are important if you want to eventually understand how to 
		survive the world, and inevitably escape it.
		<br/><br/>
		
			Teamwork is vital. Your survival will depend on it. Those who wander off alone
		in times of danger are the most vulnerable to all sorts of traps and tricks. You 
		could easily find yourself lost, maimed, killed or worse.<br/><br/>
		
			Your character should be from modern times, and have knowledge of most common modern
		technologies. The rest of their background is largely up to you.<br/><br/>
	
			As for how your character ended up in this place, they will have a vague memory 
		of walking through some sort of door shaped portal. They may have done this while awake,
		or possibly in a dream. They will generally be asleep and on the ground once they first 
		enter the world. It is very typical for a new arrival to be very confused and disoriented. 
		Knowledge of the world and its mysteries will be mostly learned through your character's experiences
		and from other characters.<br/><br/>
		
			As for possessions, your character would have whatever they were carrying at the time of entering 
		the portal. However, anything irregular, like firearms or knives need to be authorized by an admin.<br/><br/>		
					
			Your character's primary goal will most likely be to return to their day to day lives. 
		However, there are plenty of times where this may not be the case. Remember that your character's 
		objective is largely up to you, as it is based on your character's personality, memories, and ideals.<br/><br/>	
		
		If you have any questions or concerns you can ask an admin and they should be able to help you.
