		<b>ALIASES:</b> Lucia Ferreira (actual name), Maria, Kayla, The Doll, LF
	<br/><br/>
		<b>STATUS:</b> Living
	<br/><br/>
		<b>AFFILIATION:</b> Sand Sharks (Formerly), Shark Separatist & Cald Coalition (Present)
	<br/><br/>
		<b>VISUAL DESCRIPTION:</b>
	<br/><br/>
		[Standard] Of Brazilian descent, light skinned.  Visible age is early thirties (actual age 34) with long black hair, usually tied back in a ponytail.  Frequently wears mask to cover mouth.  Notable clothing includes fondness for layered apparel in temperate to cold climates.  Gold chain around neck, wedding ring with embedded shard as gem, highly pure.
	<br/><br/>
		[Shade] Figure appears to resemble a standard shade, with the usual poorly defined silhouette.  Said silhouette essentially mimics her natural appearance.  At times the blight surrounding her may swirl slowly around her in a clockwise fashion, picking up debris.
	<br/><br/>
		<b>ABILITIES:</b>
	<br/><br/>
		[Standard] Known to be knowledgeable of most aspects of endemic life found inside of Respites due to role as lead Shark medical researcher.  Worked as a doctor in an unofficial capacity in her ‘other life’ treating burns, gunshot wounds, and lacerations resulting from street confrontations or chemical accidents.  Ability to use a firearm is average at best. Unenhanced physical strength, similarly, is also mediocre.
	<br/><br/>
		[Shade] Inherited ability to ‘sap’ blight from surrounding area.  This includes blighted weapons, ammunition, body parts, shades, and CURE itself.  Sapping affords her with moderate regeneration. Inherited ability to ‘puppeteer’, in which four tentacle-like appendages made of blight appear from her back.  These appendages can latch on to living beings, controlling and manipulating them like puppets in a sort of semi-remote possession.  Adapted ability includes utilizing sand as a binding agent when blighted to mimic flesh and bone in a manner similar to “C”, simply without need for organic cells.  Organic cells are substituted with blight itself.  Additionally, she is capable of controlling sand and other dry particles to create a veil around her, to expel as a blinding attack, or to (in severe circumstances) create a sandstorm.  
	<br/><br/>
		<b>COMBAT:</b>
	<br/><br/>
		Confronting Boneca without substantial assistance is ill advised.  Having blighted equipment on your person is also ill advised when confronting her.  Similarly, most shades should not attempt to engage unless they are nimble enough to avoid her attacks or they themselves have some kind of regenerative abilities / sapping powers.  If confrontation is inevitable, we recommend sticking to range.  The tentacles used for possession do have a fairly long range, but are limited.  Boneca’s proficiency with firearms leaves some things to be desired.  However, it should be noted that the ability to control sand means that accurate attacks can be easily thwarted by obstructing visibility.
	<br/><br/>
		For this reason, we also recommend that Boneca should not be confronted (if you can) in an area with ample sand.  This means that areas with substantial amounts of beach or in places like deserts should be avoided.  Indoor areas are a good place as that can further limit her ability to locate that kind of debris.  It should be noted that dry and dead dirt, along with finely ground gravel, can be used as substitute matter for her.  This means that areas like train tunnels may actually afford her an advantage.  We believe that the best place to engage Boneca is indoors in a snowy area, or from a distance in that same area.  Her ‘other life’ and life here in the Respites largely consists of living in very warm climates, making her less comfortable with being present in those areas on top of having limited combat efficiency. She is likely aware of this, and will probably need to be baited to going there.
