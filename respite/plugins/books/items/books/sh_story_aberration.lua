<br/><br/>
The term Aberrations refers to a category of living creatures in the Void. These creatures often vary wildly from one to the other, and can be very hard to categorize for this reason. Aberrations can be mindless or intelligent, aggressive or passive, numerous or unique. There are seemingly no limits on what an Aberration can be, the only necessary qualification is that they were created in part by Blue Haze. 
<br/><br/>
The powers of Aberrations range from useless to godlike, some Aberrations can do nothing at all, while others can change the laws of physics or warp space time. It is impossible to know beforehand, thus it is important to not act rashly when dealing with any Aberration. Appearances can be especially deceptive for these chaotic creatures. 
<br/><br/>
Many have described research into Aberrations as “impossible” or “ridiculous”, and they would be absolutely correct. Aberrations are an enigma. They are chaotic, sometimes nonsensical, and often times logic defying entirely. Not only their forms, but their behaviors, their actions, their creation, everything about them is in essence, unpredictable.
<br/><br/>
One such peculiar example of this is the Drifter encounter phenomena. More often than not encountered Aberrations are not the incredibly powerful, incredibly hostile beasts that research indicates must exist. It is instead weaker creatures, or even sometimes simpler creatures that are encountered most. Almost every Aberration met in combat has had distinct limits and weaknesses, but how could this be? Considering the limitless potential of these creatures, and how there are various records from Plastics and other sources that detail seemingly unstoppable behemoths, gods, and unspeakable powers. They likely exist somewhere, and if the sources are anything to go by, they are not spectacularly rare either. Several hypotheses have been created to attempt to describe this phenomena, but there is simply not enough evidence to prove or disprove anything at all. The only thing that can be gathered is that only Drifters own this privilege, and other creatures are not so fortunate. An expedition team once encountered a massive ruin of some sort of Plastic city. Much of the city was completely crushed by a single monster, and in fact, with just one footstep. Measures of the massive footprint-shaped crater indicated that it was at least 500 km long, and 200 km wide.
<br/><br/>
One notable type of Aberration are the copies. Simply put, they are replications of Drifters. Generally they show up some time after the death of a popular or well liked person. Generally the copy is physically the same, but there can be some anomalies. The most common indicator is an immunity to the effects of Blood Haze, since they are no longer true Drifters. More often than not, these Aberrations are simply welcome members to the group, as they are exactly like the people they are copying. However, some people find moral issues with them not being “real”. Below is a short list of some of the unique anomalous behaviors found in some of these copies.
<br/><br/>
Gorilla arms.<br/>
Vomiting fish after sneezing.<br/>
Speaking French without understanding French.<br/>
Juggling without noticing.<br/>
Urges to eat strange things (tires, radios, hair, etc).<br/>
A talking sandwich with the personality of the deceased.<br/>
Walking skeleton (was in constant pain).
<br/><br/>
Needless to say, if a companion is doing anything similar to the above, they may actually be an Aberration copy, but that should not need to be said.
