	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	[W] is a breed of creature that is not entirely understood.  Encounters with [W] are not frequently reported, though the known lethality of the creature suggests that there is a strong survivorship bias in our data. 
<br/><br/>
	To begin with, we would advise all readers to be aware of some superstition. The name of this species is derived from North American folklore, but superstition holds that uttering its name aloud may cause any creatures of this type in the area to hunt for the speaker. While there is no confirmation that this is true, there are at least two cases where well-equipped reconnaissance teams that were dispatched from two separate factions lost contact with their dispatchers less than three hours after speaking the word. From this point on, the name of the creature will be mentioned, and those reading aloud are advised to simply refer to it as “creature” or “W” from this point on.
<br/><br/>
	Wendigo within the respites appear to be a manifestation of the creatures of Algonquin myth.  In nearly all sightings they are reported as enormous humanoids that have emaciated features.  A single photograph taken of one of these creatures suggests that their height is around ten feet tall given its standing relative to an overturned 1995 Toyota 4Runner.   Though their weight cannot be determined, It should be noted that, given how consistent these reports are with folklore, the emaciated features of the Wendigo should not be confused with muscular weakness.  
<br/><br/>
	The lore of how a Wendigo is created in the Respites is unknown, but speculation suggests that many are what has become of individuals that incurred the ‘Blood Haze’ through some kind of action.  In aboriginal myth, Wendigo are spirits that possess those who have become blinded by some kind of need.  It is said that in times of famine (particularly in winters) the Wendigo are most active, given that humans may begin to consider cannibalism as a means of survival.  As a result, Wendigo are most frequently associated with acts of cannibalism and an insatiable lust for some kind of item or sustenance.  However, bloodlust alone may be enough to cause a person to “become Wendigo”, especially if that person has an immense deal of rage and anger pent up inside of them.  
<br/><br/>
	Besides their size and general emaciation, the other physical features of the Wendigo lend credence to the idea that they are what remains of a mutated human.  They seem to retain a humanoid skull, and the construction of their ribcage (which is often protruding from their skin) are both in line with that of a human in terms of size.  The appendages of the Wendigo are stretched and distorted in nature, with the hands often being entirely skeletal with elongated fingers that resemble claws.  The true trademark feature of the Wendigo are their ‘points’, a term taken from sportsmen to describe the number of spikes a deer has on its antlers.  Despite their humanoid skull, a Wendigo has some form of bone protrusions coming from their craniums that greatly resemble the antlers of a deer.  It is believed that the more points a Wendigo has, the more cruel and distorted the person they once were was.  
<br/><br/>
	The last identifiable characteristic of a ‘true’ Wendigo is its camouflage.  It is thought that Wendigo are trapped within the respite that they mutated in, doomed to wander that land until they are slain (though whether they can be slain is unknown, which we will get to later).  The Wendigo adopt the features of their environment in that they all seem to have a sort of aura to them and a pigmentation to their skin.  In deserts they are reported to have sand that floats around them, in woodlands leaves, and in tundra or snowy areas snow.  Their flesh, or what remains of it, is affected in a similar fashion.  In deserts the flesh may appear to be flayed by the sand and may wave out like tattered cloth.  In woodlands lichen and moss may grow on it, and in snow-covered lands their bodies may be encased in ice.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>INTERACTIONS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Those who do not heed the warnings of the Wendigo may believe they are brave and capable enough to kill it.  Regardless of where a Wendigo is born and is trapped, it is believed that the final stage for the conversion to becoming a Wendigo involves having the heart of the human to become frozen in ice.  This ice however is like stone.  Given how few reports of combat with one of these creatures are complete, it is unknown whether this frozen heart is vulnerable or not.  In folklore the heart must be punctured, shattered, and then those fragments must be locked into a silver box in order to prevent regeneration.  Given that silver seems to be how werewolves of lore are actually dealt with, we do not believe that is an effective solution.  That being said, the puncturing and shattering of the heart may be sufficient to buy time to escape.  Unlike in the expanses of the real world, there are fixed confines in a Respite that a Wendigo may not be able to breach.
