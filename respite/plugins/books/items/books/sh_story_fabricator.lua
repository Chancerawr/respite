The Fabricator is a device well known to most drifters. This table-like device is an advanced portal device that connects to a respite where the materials are used to create the desired objects. This respite is typically referred to as the Factory. 
	<br/><br/>
The device itself is a wooden table with a monitor, and a hole to drop objects into. The monitor reacts to touch, allowing a user to select a “recipe”, which will display the materials required for the object described. The user will then only have to provide the materials by placing them into the hole, and then the object will be created. The opening in the Fabricator is thought to be a direct portal into the Factory, but no experiments have ever been able to verify this. The portal will not accept anything not on the resource list of the craftable item, anything put into it that is not on the list will be sent back out with some amount of force.
	<br/><br/>
The Factory itself is essentially a massive respite mostly composed of assembly machinery. When it receives materials via a fabricator, they are automatically sent to the assembly location, and are constructed by the machines. The constructed object is then sent back through the correct fabricator portal, and given to the user. Strangely, it appears that some people on average receive higher quality results from the Factory. These people are typically experienced with crafting, creating, or repairing items in general. Mechanics and handymen seem to have an advantage, but strangely, those with medical skills also receive some sort of advantage. This seems to imply that the Factory has some way of knowing who is using it, and what their abilities are like. It is unknown why the Factory has this preference, or even how it works, but it is assumed to be related to the fabricator portal device, rather than the Factory. Theoretically, it is possible to travel to the Factory, but it is rare. There are only a few accounts of anyone travelling to the location, and all of them provide conflicting information. While some reported incredible dangers, others reported seeing nothing dangerous for weeks. 
	<br/><br/>
There are no records that give any indication of when the Factory was created, or by whom. There are rumors that it was related to 7192’s endless war, but there is little surviving information from that respite to verify these rumors. The theory is plausible, as the respite would have had the resources, the researchers, and the manpower to create such a device, and there are many other devices in a similar vein that are thought to come from this era as well. Unfortunately, there is little surviving information from that time, leading to many devices, including this one, to lack verifiable background information.
