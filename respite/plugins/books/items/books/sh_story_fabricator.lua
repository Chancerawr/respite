	The Fabricator is a device well known to most drifters. This table-like device is essentially an advanced portal device that connects to a respite where the materials are used to create the desired objects. This respite is typically referred to as the Factory. 
<br/><br/>
	There are no records that give any indication of when the Factory was created, or by whom. There are rumors that it is related to 7192’s endless war, but there is no way to verify this due to the circumstances of that Respite. These rumors surfaced due to the excessive use of it during the war, and the fact that no records exist of it before the war started. However, considering the length of the “endless” war, it is impossible to tell whether it was created for that purpose or not.
<br/><br/>
	The Factory itself is essentially a massive respite mostly composed of assembly machinery. When it receives materials via a fabricator, they are automatically sent to the assembly location, and are constructed by the machines. The constructed object is then sent back through the correct fabricator portal, and given to the user. There have been no reported cases of the machines ever making a mistake. However, it appears that some people on average receive higher quality results from the Factory. These people are typically experienced with crafting, creating, or repairing items in general. Mechanics and handymen seem to have an advantage, but strangely, those with medical skills also receive some sort of advantage. This seems to imply that the Factory has some way of knowing who is using it, and what their abilities are like. It is unknown why the Factory has this preference, or even how it works, but it is assumed to be related to the fabricator portal device, rather than the Factory. Theoretically, it is possible to travel to the Factory, but it seems rare, and there are no known accounts of anyone ever going there and returning. This leads to the belief that it is either incredibly dangerous there, or that the respite is incredibly unlikely to open up.
