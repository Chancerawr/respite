The Void is the term referring to the theoretical space that all respites are within. It is so far impossible to go into the Void itself, as it is simply the absence of respites, which is nothingness. The term is generally used to refer to the entire array of all respites and other anomalies connected to them. 
	<br/><br/>
There are two major regions within the Void. One that can be visually represented as being “above”, is where most Void creatures tend to inhabit. The area filled with both abandoned and unabandoned respites. The area represented as being “below”, is classified as the Faux, where generally proto-drifters and shades can be found.
	<br/><br/>
There is currently no method of travel from upper to lower respites, and traversal from lower to upper is for the most part, completely random. Travel in the upper layer typically involves portals that go from one respite to another. However, in respites that have a high drifter population, it is not all too uncommon for monolith’s to appear that allow transport between areas. These monoliths are actually full respites, which have for one reason or another, ended up within another respite. It is completely unclear why this ever occurs, and brings about a variety of questions for the physics involved in such a thing. Nonetheless, it is a useful circumstance that should be considered if the current respite is particularly dangerous. 
	<br/><br/>
What the Void really is, and why it exists is a subject to great debate among researchers and drifters everywhere. It is uncertain if there is unexplored portions of the void, whether it can really be escaped, or even if any of it is real at all. Many wander from place to place, searching for answers to these questions, but due to the nature of the Void, many fear they will never truly be answered, at least not by anyone that can share that information with anyone else.
