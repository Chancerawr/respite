	A chill raced down his spine as he stared out across the water.  Despite the fact that it was a summer evening in the American Northeast, the cool waters of the bay brought with them brisk winds to chill the bones of whose who had warmed themselves in the sun hours prior.  Tonight was no different as the clear air and sky created the perfect environment for the breeze to play across the top of the water.

	The boat rocked gently, but the movement was more noticeable from where he was standing upon the bridge of the vessel.  The engine was off and the anchor was dropped.  Had it not been for the commotion on the deck below him, he would have been able to enjoy a quiet and peaceful night out with the sounds of seawater lapping against the fiberglass hull lulling him to sleep rather than the drunken speech of his friends.

	For a civilian vessel the boat was a fair size, but not enough where the raised volume of the conversations on the main deck could go ignored.  He tried to however, and chose to focus on other items of interest.  The twinkling lights of a bridge in the distance were visible, with a rare pair of headlights dancing across them every once in awhile; despite the very late hour, some people were still out and about.  A flexible plastic served as the cover and protection for the captain should he have been on the bridge instead of reveling below.  This plastic could be opened and closed through the use of a zipper to allow warm air inside, or to keep cool air out.  On this particular evening the zippers were closed, but one particular portion of the plastic did not have its closed fully, so the sound of the plastic rapping against itself with the faint ‘clink’ of its zipper could be heard.

	It was a different entity that caught his attention.  Naturally, it was a woman.  While he gazed longingly down towards the bow of the boat with a cool canned beer in hand, she and the two other girls accompanying her were leaning against the safety wires, smiling and laughing at one another while they were engaged in conversation.  He wanted to be a part of it, to move to be with her and try to finally raise the courage to date a girl, but the chills of the night air and the fear of rejection froze him to his spot.  On this bridge with its enclosed fiberglass roof and plastic weatherproofing, he was secure and alone.

	Being alone had always been his form of security, but it had always been what hindered his ability to take risks that would have been beneficial to him.  It was a wonder that he had been invited to this party.  The small nearby island in the bay, an old military installation that had been abandoned for decades, was one he was familiar with as he and his friends had explored it many times.  Maybe it was his knowledge of the island that made him an attractive recruit for this party; after all, having a dozen drunken college kids lost on an island in the dark, albeit a small one, was rather dangerous considering the old caved-in cisterns and tunnels that littered the land.

	A smile crept across his face as he recalled a photo where he and three others stood atop the tall concrete lookout tower on the eastern side, the side opposite to where the boat was anchored, but the smile faded as he remembered that those boys had changed greatly from when they had been friends.  They grew up, did he?   With another glance ahead he looked at the bridge and saw more headlights flash across it.  He reasoned at that moment that he had grown up, and chose to descend the ladder and embark towards the bow.
