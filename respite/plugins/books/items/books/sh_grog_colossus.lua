		<b>ALIASES:</b> Adam Richmond (actual name), 2IC
<br/><br/>
		<b>STATUS:</b> Living
<br/><br/>
		<b>AFFILIATION:</b> Sand Sharks (Present)
<br/><br/>
		<b>VISUAL DESCRIPTION:</b>
<br/><br/>
		[Standard] Colossus’s unique ability to regenerate flesh, bone, and even hair has enabled him to retain an entirely human appearance.  He is visually identical to his uncorrupted self, with tanned skin and a muscular build.  He stands at above six feet, with a body weight of roughly 180 pounds.  He is often clad in casual clothes beneath combat gear, though he does not elect to wear extensive armor protection due to the nature of his ability.
<br/><br/>
		[Shade] There is are some exceptions to the standard appearance.  Colossus can mold himself to resemble other individuals, especially if he has access to Pinocchio’s memories of those persons or the person themselves.  Additionally, the ‘stability’ of Colossus’s body is dependent on his temperament.  When enraged, the veins in his body may become visible as they blacken from the blight coursing through his body.  If exposed to high concentrations of blight while in this state, his body may actually become engulfed in blightfire, blighting all of his flesh and making him appear as a traditional shade until he calms himself.  
<br/><br/>
		<b>ABILITIES:</b>
<br/><br/>
		[Human] Highly proficient in firearms and military tactics. Served in the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards Regiment, with intermittent deployments between 2005 to 2011.  Served under both Durand and Levesque/Gepetto during the Plastic War as a Pathfinder.  Following his receipt of extensive wounds during an ambush, Richmond was used as Gepetto’s first ‘walker’ until [CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE] was fully developed.  Richmond was the first human test subject for the substance, and his body was fully restored.  Extensive time spent with Gepetto has led to a great understanding of his abilities, making him an essential part of the training for other Gepetto heirs.
<br/><br/>
		[Shade] Shade abilities likely a result of [CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE] testing during his time spent as a human.  His regeneration abilities are unparalleled, allowing him to relocate organs within his flesh, harden said flesh, or repair damaged limbs.  Not only can he perform his ability on himself, but he can expend some of his own energy to heal others. Unlike when he heals himself however, Colossus’s healing on other individuals is not immediate and takes time.  The constructed limbs or organs also are not fully functional, and often require the recipient to take time to restore their muscle and operability, similar to [CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE].
<br/><br/>
		Colossus is also recognized as having a certain resistance to some of Pinocchio’s curse abilities, likely because he was the first heir to be appointed by Gepetto.  As of this writing, Colossus is the only shade among the heirs who has killed another shade (Rico). 
<br/><br/>
		<b>COMBAT:</b>
<br/><br/>
		If confronted in combat, the best way to deal with Colossus is engaging in a fight of endurance.  While Colossus excels at close-combat and can stay in a fight for extended periods of time, he must use up some of his own energy to restore his flesh or harden it.  Increased damage can be dealt from sharded weaponry, though it is not nearly as straightforward as with other shades.  Hits with sharded weapons on already wounded locations can delay healing, but the sheer strength of Colossus’s blight seems able to negate the effects after some time.
<br/><br/>
		As of this writing, the only shades that seem to rival Colossus’s abilities among the Sharks, Shark Separatists, and Cald would be Boneca and Calderon.  The former possesses similar regeneration abilities and has access to a great quantity of blight to assure solid endurance, while the latter can decay Colossus’s cells at approximately the same rate as he can regenerate them.
