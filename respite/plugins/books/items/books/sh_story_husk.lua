	A husk is somewhat of an alternative to the shadow statues created when someone returns to the Faux. Husks are created when a drifter's consciousness exits the void through one way or another. This can be seen with the large portals that bring people out of the Void, and with wraiths. In the case of wraiths, it is unknown what truly happens to a drifter’s consciousness as their body is turned into a husk. However, it is assumed to not send the drifter back to the real world, and instead “something” else happens to them. It is unknown what this “something” is, but most believe it to be anything but pleasant.
<br/><br/>
	A husk is what many would describe as a soulless body, hence the name. As for physical features, a husk will appear to be a strange, changed version of the drifter whose consciousness once inhabited. Its eyes and mouth will instead be black, empty abysses that many people find very hard to look at. Its movements will be sluggish, and slow. It will occasionally twitch for seemingly no reason, and with no purpose. Many would describe a husk’s general appearance to be “very uncomfortable to look at”.
<br/><br/>
	Husks do not need to eat, drink, or even breathe. It is difficult to say if they can really even be killed, as often the flesh of their bodies continues to survive even after decapitation or removal of necessary human organs. After the brain has been removed or destroyed, the body will stop moving entirely, but its flesh could hypothetically live on forever, not that it would accomplish anything.
<br/><br/>
	The behavior of a husk can vary, often they will repeat activities the drifter performed in the past over and over again. There is no purpose or meaning in anything they do, and to Drifters, they are almost completely harmless. However, it is common practice to destroy husks, as they can be demoralizing to look upon, and many believe them to be bringers of misfortune. Common practice by many drifters has been to burn the husk to ash, and then bury or scatter the ashes in a respectful location.
<br/><br/>
	Abominations and wraiths completely ignore husks in all cases, even when harm is coming to then at the hands of a husk. Aberrations, when asked, acknowledge that the creatures exist, but often want absolutely nothing to do with them. Plastics react in a variety of ways. Some groups fear them, while others revere them as something sacred.
<br/><br/>
	There has never been a case of a husk returning to normal, implying that once a person’s consciousness leaves the Void, they can never return, or if they do, not in the same body.
