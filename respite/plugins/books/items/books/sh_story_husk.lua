Husks are created when a drifter's consciousness exits the void through one way or another. This can be seen with the large portals that bring people out of the Void, and with wraiths. In the case of wraiths, it is unknown what truly happens to a drifter’s consciousness as their body is turned into a husk. However, it is assumed to not send the drifter back to the real world, and instead “something else” happens to them. It is unknown what this is, but most have no desire to find out.

A husk is what many would describe as a soulless body, that being the basis for its name. As for physical features, a husk appears to be a strange, unsettling version of the drifter whose consciousness is now gone. Strange, pitch black abysses exist where its mouth and eyes once were. Most avoid looking directly into them, and those that do can end up stuck staring at them for several minutes before noticing. The creature’s movements will be sluggish, and unpredictable. It will occasionally twitch for seemingly no reason, and sometimes its body will contort and twist by itself. Husks that have existed for any amount of time often have small injuries, such as cuts as bruises in various locations on their bodies. These injuries typically come about from the husk’s own clumsy movements in various environments.
	<br/><br/>
Husks do not need to eat, drink, or even breathe. It is difficult to say if they can really even be killed, as often the flesh of their bodies continues to survive even after decapitation or removal of necessary human organs. After the brain has been removed or destroyed, the body will stop moving entirely, but it is possible that even then, the creature is still “alive”, just simply unable to move.
	<br/><br/>
The behavior of a husk can vary, often they will repeat activities the drifter performed in the past over and over again. There is no purpose or meaning in anything they do, and to drifters, they are almost completely harmless. However, it is common practice to destroy husks, as their haunting appearance and disturbing actions can be very demoralizing. Many believe them to be bad omen, or bringers of misfortune. Common practice by many drifters has been to burn the husk to ash, and then bury or scatter the ashes in a respectful location.
	<br/><br/>
Almost all unintelligent Void creatures ignore husks entirely, even a rampant abominations will simply pass one by, as if it were not there at all. They will even go as far as to ignore a husk if it is causing direct harm to them. There have been cases of husks repeating hunting patterns of their previous consciousnesses, and in turn, fought and slayed abominations. The abominations, seemingly being unable to perceive or react to the husk at all, just stood there as they were chopped to pieces. The drifter who observed this interaction said the scene was “simply disturbing”. Intelligent lifeforms react in any manner of ways, some plastics may worship them, while others exterminate them. 
	<br/><br/>
There has never been a case of a husk returning to normal, implying that once a person’s consciousness leaves the Void, they can never return, or if they do, not in the same body.
