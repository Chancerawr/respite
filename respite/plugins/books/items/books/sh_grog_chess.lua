	[The book begins with the usual kind of preface that you would expect from such a book.  The author lays out the game of chess and its history.  He describes it as a game with origins in the area of India that spread in all directions thanks to the Silk Road.  The greatest adopters of the game, the Persians, were responsible for spreading the activity into Europe. What follows this brief history lesson is a coverage of the fundamentals and rules of the game.  He then discusses individual pieces.]
<br/><br/>	
<br/><br/>	
	PAWN (1PT):
<br/><br/>	
	The phrase “pawn” is befitting of this piece.  The origin of its name is a sort of “chicken or egg” situation, in which there is uncertainty as to whether the game lent meaning to a ‘pawn’ as being weak and easily manipulated or sacrificed, or if that meaning was simply attributed to this piece.  Regardless, the pawn is oft viewed as a sacrificial lamb for opening up your forces for attack, blocking enemy attacks, or protecting other pieces as human shields.  
<br/><br/>	
	Lore surrounding this piece holds that it represents medieval spearmen.  The cumbersome board-shields that these individuals wielded would hinder visibility, making it so that the best angles of attack when engaging in combat would be 45 degrees to the spearman’s left or right.  Hence, the movement and attack patterns of the pawn.  
<br/><br/>	
	[A diagram shows a picture of a spearman attempting to jab to targets on his forward diagonals]
<br/><br/>	
	Two special rules are to be remembered about pawns.  First, on their first move they may advance two squares instead of the usual one.  This makes them ideal for taking control of the middle of the board in the early game.  Second, a pawn that reaches the back rank of the board, crossing all six squares, may be promoted into any piece.  Often, the pawn is promoted to a Queen.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>	
	QUEEN (9PT): 
<br/><br/>	
	From the weakest piece we move to the strongest piece.  She can attack in any direction with unrestricted distance, making her an incredible threat for the opposing team.  It is not unlikely that in a match one party may sacrifice their own queen to capture the opponent’s queen to simply give themselves more breathing room.
<br/><br/>	
	This piece was originally known as the ‘vizier’, or the ‘prime minister’ in Sanskrit.  This name may be more fitting in terms of the role of the piece, given that it is by far the most adept combatant, whereas a queen usually resides away from the field of battle within the confines of her castle.  
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>	
	ROOK (5PT).
<br/><br/>	
	Two potential origins are given for the piece.  The first holds that the Rook was meant to represent a chariot. The other says it represents a siege tower.  Those familiar with the Old Testament may recall that chariots were a weapon to be feared in battle, a sort of ‘tank’ in their own time.  The mobility of these vehicles and their destructive capacity lent them to serve as a means of causing great chaos and damage in the opposition.  
<br/><br/>	
	In the game, the Rook may still serve this purpose.  It has unlimited mobility on all horizontal and vertical planes, though it cannot attack on a diagonal.  This makes it an ideal piece for “sniping” pieces of the other army, or for containing less mobile pieces like a king or pawn to a certain group of columns or rows.  
<br/><br/>	
	Notable tactics include the “barrage”, in which two rooks ‘stack’ on one another with one piece behind the other on a plane of attack.  If two rooks are present in the endgame, they are ideal for slowly forcing the king into the back rank of the board and causing a checkmate by blocking off escape.
<br/><br/>	
	A special move of note here would be the “king’s castle”, in which a king that has not moved and a rook that has not moved can shift to create a better defensive positon.
<br/><br/>	
	[An image demonstrating this move can be seen]
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>	
	KNIGHT (3PT).
<br/><br/>	
	Cavalry, chaos.  The knight is the only piece that may “jump” other pieces.  It is forced to move in an “L” pattern, with three squares making up the long part and two for the short part.
<br/><br/>	
	[A diagram shows the range of movement for a knight]
<br/><br/>	
	Naturally this piece, represented by a horse, indicates the mobility of cavalry as it bounds around the battlefield, overcoming obstacles. Offensively, the knight is incredibly potent.  Defensively, it is inadequate at defending itself directly but fair at defending other pieces.  
<br/><br/>	
	A wise thing to remember about this piece is that knights rely on mobility for survival.  Placing a night on the edge of the board is incredibly risky and unwise.  
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
	BISHOP (3PT).
<br/><br/>	
	The bishop again has some uncertainty as to what it represents.  In India it was a war elephant.  In Europe it was frequently known as a messenger or runner in Germanic territories.  Today, we know it as a man of god that is capable of moving and attacking on diagonals for any distance.  One can look at a bishop as having the attack potential of a rook combined with the directions of a pawn (besides the fact that a pawn cannot move backwards).   
<br/><br/>	
	An important tactic to recall for bishops is that they cannot move vertically or horizontally.  This means that you will have a bishop on white and black squares.  Should you lose either, you will not have a bishop that can deny access to a certain colored square.  Ergo, this piece should be used defensively, or in a support role.
<br/><br/>	
<br/><br/>
	KING (N/A)
<br/><br/>	
	The final piece.  The king cannot be lost, lest the game be lost.  Putting a piece in a position to attack the enemy’s king prompts a “check”.  The enemy must then move their king to safety, shield him from it, or dispatch the threatening piece.  The king has mobility in all directions, albeit he is confined to one square in any direction.
<br/><br/>	
	In terms of tactics, recall King’s Castle from the “Rook” section.  
<br/><br/>	
	[A diagram of King’s Castle is shown again]
<br/><br/>	
	Furthermore, do not be afraid in the late game to use your king offensively.  The king is a good way of denying movement for the enemy king, although you cannot move your own king into a position where he would be in check.
