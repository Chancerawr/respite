Blue Haze generally refers a weather anomaly that significantly limits visibility, and often negatively affects those that are caught within it. However, it can also refer to a captured gaseous substance with a variety of useful properties.
<br/><br/>
Blue Haze (weather) distorts electronics when it is in the area, this appears to happen regardless of whether or not the electronics make contact with the haze. Abominations are absent when the Blue Haze arrives, even in locations with severe pillar presence, Abominations are completely absent for the duration of the Blue Haze. 
<br/><br/>
Drifters or Plastics caught out in the weather will often begin to hallucinate. These hallucinations vary wildly, and are seemingly far more random than Black Haze hallucinations. They could potentially be anything at all, depending on the one hallucinating. Some observed hallucinations are noted below:
<br/><br/>
27 flying banjos.
<br/>
Dancing hamburgers, but one isn’t dancing and is just sad.
<br/>
Cyborg hands, but the middle finger is golden.
<br/>
Raining cats and dogs.
<br/>
Guns that shoot spaghetti.
<br/>
Walking bread people.
<br/>
Fish vomiting.
<br/>
Chairs with legs.
<br/><br/>
The Blue Haze cannot be stopped by a gas mask, as it requires only skin contact to infiltrate the body, this is why it still affects Plastics. However, breathing in Blue Haze does speed up the process, so wearing a gas mask still proves slightly useful. To completely avoid Blue Haze, one must be wearing a protective suit that can cover their entire body.
<br/><br/>
Also notable is that during Blue Haze, Aberrations are typically more powerful, and more common. They are not generally violent at all during this time unless they are attacked or endangered. The bonuses of Blue Haze depend on the Aberration entirely, it appears that the bonuses are wholly dependant on their abilities and their personality.
<br/><br/>
After Blue Haze has passed through the area, there will often be strange bottles filled with the haze itself. It is unknown if the bottles fall from the haze, or just simply appear. Inhaling the gas from the bottle has a similar effect as walking around in the haze itself, and be utilized for incredibly disorienting haze bombs. When used against Abominations, they appear to become more docile, but this can vary depending on the size of the Abomination. Larger Abominations will require much more haze to pacify.
<br/><br/>
Blue Haze is strongly related to the creation of Aberrations, and can in fact be used by Drifters and only Drifters, to actually form new Aberrations. Creating an Aberration requires an abundance of Blue Haze. Combining this abundance with any objects or materials will often create some sort of Aberration. In some cases it can even be used to replace limbs.
<br/><br/>
In the case of limb replacement and other healing techniques involving Blue Haze, it can be disastrous, but it can also be life saving. For a limb or organ to be replaced, it must first be removed from the Drifter’s body. It is important to keep in mind that replacing a limb with Blue Haze means that a Drifter is now completely connected to an Aberration. This can sometimes mean that the limb may not always do what the Drifter wants it to do. Below is a list of effects based on the amount of haze utilized.
<br/><br/>
Limbs:
<br/>
15 bottles : Strength comparable to original limb, somewhat difficult to control for weak willed.
<br/>
(5+ will roll needed)
<br/>
30 bottles : Far stronger than regular arm, very difficult to control.
<br/>
(10+ will roll needed)
<br/>
45 bottles : Limb has a personality, and its own desires, incredibly difficult to control, may attempt to attack Drifter.
<br/>
(15+ will roll needed)
<br/><br/>
Organs:
<br/>
15 bottles : Performs the same as regular organ, sometimes causes Blue Haze hallucinations.
<br/>
30 bottles : Far better performance, enhancing body depending on organ. Nearly constant Blue Haze hallucinations.
<br/>
45 bottles : Will transform the entire Drifter into an Aberration, this will destroy the Drifter’s memories and personality.
<br/><br/>
Replacing the brain of any creature with Blue Haze will turn the creature into an Aberration. The power of said Aberration will vary depending on the strength of the creature pre transformation. The new Aberration will have no memories of what it was before, and its personality may be completely different as well. 
<br/><br/>
It is highly recommended to avoid Blue Haze medical treatments unless danger of Shadowification is exceptionally high. It is also recommended to only give Aberration replacements or enhancements to those of sound mind or strong will, otherwise they may have difficulties controlling and properly using whatever is given to them.
<br/><br/>
Objects can seemingly be enhanced by Blue Haze as well, but as seen before, this simply turns the object into an Aberration. This can be very useful, but also very dangerous. An Aberration-enhanced object may have abilities that make it better than a standard piece of equipment or armor, it does not necessarily wish to use those abilities for the betterment of the one wielding it. Just as with body part replacements, the object’s strength and controllability will depend on the amount of haze used to create it. Be wary of objects that can easily sabotage the user in combat, and be especially careful and kind to Aberration objects, otherwise they may cease being useful, and instead be detrimental.
<br/><br/>
An Aberration created by a Drifter will have no innate memory of loyalties to said Drifters, and it may attack them immediately after creation, thus it is very important to be prepared in such a circumstance. The greater the amount of haze used in the creation of the Aberration, the greater its strength will be. However, the more haze used can also sometimes cause the creature to be more “silly”, which is dangerous in its own way.
<br/><br/>
15 bottles : fairly weak Aberration, may lack intelligence. Chance of rebelling low.
<br/>
(5+ will roll needed)
<br/>
30 bottles : Can be just as capable as a Drifter in terms of physical abilities and intelligence. Chance of rebelling moderate.
<br/>
(10+ will roll needed)
<br/>
45 bottles : Powerful Aberration, could have devastating abilities . Chance of rebelling high.
<br/>
(20+ will roll needed)
<br/>
100+ bottles : Unspeakable terrors, avoid this at all costs. Man was not meant to create gods.
<br/> 
(50+ will roll needed)
