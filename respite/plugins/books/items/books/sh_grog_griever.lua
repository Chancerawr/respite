	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Grievers are a predatory abomination that closely resemble a large anteater.  The largest creatures of these creatures can grow to be approximately nine feet in length without including their curled tails.  They are much leaner than anteaters and have a khaki colored short fur.  Their paws are armed with razor-sharp claws, and their speed enables them to strike swiftly to make their prey begin to bleed.  Their long snouts contribute to an adept sense of smell which they use to track blood.  Their sense of taste also contributes to their proficiency as a tracker.
<br/><br/>
	<b>INTERACTIONS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Unlike an anteater, the tongue of the Griever is not used to transport prey into its fanged maw.  Rather, the Griever’s tongue has a strange property that allows it to stimulate the organs of its dead prey.  The Grievers are intelligent, and will often stimulate the respiratory organs or throats of dead animals or even humans in order to call out for help.  These calls are mimicked based on their strong cognitive abilities, but often they will simply repeat the last calls made by their prey prior to their demise.  The name ‘Griever’ has its origins from the rescue teams that would respond to cries for help, only to find these kinds of creatures standing on their hind legs over the corpse as though mourning.  
<br/><br/>
	Grievers tend to travel in small packs of only three or four.  While their dens are separate, the pack members will orient themselves in their hunting grounds to allow prey to reach the center before encircling.  Often the centers of these hunting territories are water sources, especially in desert or snowy environments where easy access to surface water is difficult.  
<br/><br/>
	The furs of the Grievers do not change colors based on their environment.  The khaki-beige fur enables them to blend in well to almost every climate save for snow.  To adapt to these regions, Grievers will make their fur go tense and roll in the snow in order to shroud themselves.  This tension in fur is a trademark behavior that indicates that the creature either feels threatened or has sensed prey nearby, but this indicator is unreliable in the snow.  
<br/><br/>
	When in Griever territory, it is suggested that teams are not dispatched in numbers less than two.  This is to ensure that lone scavengers are not picked off and used to bait additional prey into the killbox.  Given the small sizes of Griever packs, a squad of four should be sufficient to cover all bases.  This squad size is also ideal given that it allows a patrol to monitor possible angles of approach for the predators.  Grievers tend to be ambush hunters and will not strike if they believe their position is known.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>USES:</b>
<br/><br/>
	The hairs of the Grievers are highly sought after for their use in crafting various brushes.  The bristles can be made firm with some adhesive to create an abrasive device that functions similarly to sandpaper or steel wool.  
<br/><br/>
	The hides of the Grievers are often a byproduct of the brush-manufacturing process.  They are not as thick or firm other creatures and are not entirely suitable for warm or reinforced clothing, but they can be manufactured into leather.  The dull nature of this leather makes it a popular interior cover in vehicles, especially those with utilitarian implements.  In other cases the leathers are used to create comfort stocks and grips for bows or firearms.
