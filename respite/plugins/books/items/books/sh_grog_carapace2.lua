	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	A Carapace Thrall refers to a corpse that is being used as a spawning bed by a Carapace Bug.  Carapace Spawns refer to the sizable maggot-like creatures that adorn the corpse.  Carapace Thralls and their associated Spawn are most commonly sighted in dank or swampy environments with large amounts of water or humidity.  They enjoy confined, dark spaces like flooded tunnels, sewers, or sunken caves and may emerge from their hideouts to hunt smaller creatures (including humans) in order to use their corpses as larval beds.
<br/><br/>
	Given the variety of candidates that Carapace Spawn have to use as their thrall, physical identification is often difficult.  However, the creatures somewhat resemble the monster species known as the ‘Leecher’ in that much of what remains on the body of the corpse as it is being slowly consumed are veins, muscle, and various organs.  This tissue is sustained by the spawn in order to ensure that they can use the corpse as a vessel to hunt, escape danger, or to defend themselves from any who would attempt to halt their growth.  Given our mental abilities, human corpses are the most popular thrall candidate, and Carapace Thralls are often reported as bipedal with two arms and a human skull as a result.  While these thralls may be a sort of ‘possessed zombie’ in a fashion similar to an Empty, they do not seem to possess any sight and do not make use of the body to touch, smell, or taste.  Rather, the body itself functions more as a weapon and a feeding ground so that the Spawn nesting in and on it can have a sustainable food source. Whether or not hearing is retained by the corpse is up for debate, as it does seem to have an incredibly keen sense.  However, given the behavior of a mature Carapace Bug, the hearing may be the result of the Spawn rather than the corpse itself.  Besides using the body as a shield and weapon, the Spawn may use their Thrall as a means of calling for help, though a moaning sound may also be emitted in confined spaces to echo-locate possible prey.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>INTERACTIONS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	While the Thrall itself may be able to deliver a blunt force attack to prey to incapacitate them, the most dangerous part of a Thrall are its spawn.  The maggot-like spawn can vary greatly in size.  They will emerge from the corpse as thin and spindly creatures, often a sickly pale green in color and having the diameter of a pencil.  From there they will squirm down the arm of the thrall to attempt to latch onto a target.  Once the spawn have latched onto prey, they will try to burrow into the target to reach a vital organ such as the lungs, heart, kidneys, or brain.  Their burrowing however is done in the dermal layer of the flesh, meaning that a spawn can be struck and killed while it is burrowing within.  
<br/><br/>
	Spawn also serve as a sacrificial defense mechanism for the collective.  The Carapace Bug and its offspring’s preference for aquatic environments stem from the membrane that makes up their flesh.  When engorged with water or another fluid, the flesh of the spawn hardens and turns the spawn into sort of armor plate about the size of a neck pillow.  The aforementioned veins, organs, and muscles that the spawn maintain on their Thrall are used to move these fluids around the body.  At times these organs may be used to blind or distract opponents in order to make an escape.
<br/><br/>
	The hardened spawn behave as a rather thick chitin plate than can often only be fully penetrated by full rifle calibers.  Stabbing and slashing attacks are often ineffective, but strong blunt force delivered to a Spawn may cause its internal organs to rupture, making them fall off the creature.  Extreme heat has proven to be one of the best methods of dealing with the Thralls, as the evaporation of any fluids in the membranes or veins will cause the Spawns to inflate with gas and likely explode.  The flames may also evaporate the fluids necessary to cause the membranes to harden in the first place.  Two somewhat questionable methods exist to dispatch Thralls as well.  In one case CURE / Blight fluids may be used as bait to cause the creature to engorge itself with the substance.  This may destroy the Thrall or blight and kill off the Spawn feeding on it.  Gasoline has also been used to some moderate effect, where the creature will suck in the gas before it is ignited, causing its insides to burn and a times creating an incapacitating explosion.
<br/><br/>
	<b>USES:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Intact Spawn membranes have found some value among factions and occupations that engage in a great deal of diving.  The membranes are often too heavy when engorged with fluid to be a practical body armor, but at times they are used to create diving suits that harden while underwater to give the wearers some protection without adding weight. Fully intact spawn can also be used as inflatables given the elasticity of their membranes, and are popular with divers again in that oxygen can be redirected to them to rapidly ascend.
