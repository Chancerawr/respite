Ichor is a white liquid that creates a small amount of light and seemingly moves by itself. It is a core component of wraiths, and typically can be found in areas where wraiths can also be found. The substance has use through various devices,  but can be dangerous if used improperly or without caution.
	<br/><br/>
Ichor, as stated before, is a core component of wraiths. Ichor can also easily take shape and become a wraith by itself, provided enough of it is in a single location. To prevent this, it is best to store ichor in vials or other closed containers.
	<br/><br/>
Ichor can also be dangerous if improperly handled. Ichor, if allowed to enter some organic material, and even some inorganic material, will somehow take control, and form something similar to a wraith. This is commonly seen with memories and weaker abominations. Furthermore, if ichor manages to enter a drifterâ€™s body, it may attempt to take over sections of it, effectively turning body parts into wraiths, which will then proceed to attack anything that is not a wraith. Normally, this is not too common of an occurrence, as using ichor as a weapon carries the risk of your own weapon turning against you.
	<br/><br/>
Shards destroy ichor much like they do blight, and are an effective way to cleanse something of ichor as well. Even ichor infected limbs or creatures can be purged of ichor through this manner. However, if too much time has passed, the ichor will have effectively killed whatever it has infested, making it unlikely for a body part to survive even after being purged.
	<br/><br/>
When ichor makes contact with blight, it creates a shockwave that damages anything around it. This goes for wraiths and shades as well. This reaction can be utilized for disorienting blasts, and even a weapon against shades if used carefully enough.
	<br/><br/>
The substance itself can be destroyed, and often should be destroyed if there is an excess amount of it that cannot properly be stored. The most effective way to destroy ichor is to use shard material, the second most effective is to burn it. Both of these methods carry little risk during the disposal itself, but can attract unwanted attention from abominations or other creatures. 
	<br/><br/>
It is unclear whether ichor itself is alive, while some wraiths show seemingly intelligent actions, ichor typically just moves about randomly, or towards other sources of ichor. However, there have been many cases of ichor performing unexpectedly, and accomplishing miraculous escapes from containment vessels and other forms of capture. It is best not to underestimate the substance, and to not have more than necessary for whatever it is being used for.
