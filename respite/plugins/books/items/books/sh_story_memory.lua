A “memory” is a triangular object that is often used by a variety of creatures in the Void for a variety of purposes. Its usefulness cannot be understated, with some groups even using it as a currency due to its prevalence and value.
	<br/><br/>
Memories are fairly common, and most experienced drifters will have seen many. Memories can be found on the bodies of slain shades, wraiths, or just randomly throughout abandoned respites. They can also be created or retrieved using a variety of devices and ingredients.
	<br/><br/>
Physical contact with a memory typically gives a drifter a certain emotion, such emotion depends entirely on the memory itself. The emotional effect of the memory never diminishes, no matter how long or often it is used. There are also no permanent side effects. While the emotion may linger for a short time after physical contact is ceased, there has never been a case where the emotion lasted longer than a few hours afterwards.
	<br/><br/>
The object itself is seemingly an amalgamation of the actual thoughts and memories of a living creature, and some sort of energy created by the Void itself. This energy can be utilized and released by creatures, and devices, making it a useful resource for almost all intelligent creatures, and even some unintelligent ones. 
	<br/><br/>
It is possible for some to “read” the memory as well. However, it appears that only those with particularly strong mental fortitude are able to do this at all. In experiments with a local seer, it appears that most of the memories analyzed involved the final segment of a drifter’s life. There were physical details as well as descriptions of thoughts and feelings of the drifter in their final moments. The memory also often included information on what became of their consciousness after their end, but most of this was cryptic and subject to interpretation. It is thought that stronger emotions lead to the creation of memories, which results in memories of death being quite common. While shades are known to easily be able to read memories, it is not recommended to give memories to shades for reading purposes, as the shade may use the memory for nefarious purposes.
	<br/><br/>
While most memories involve the moments before a drifter’s death, plenty of memories of other times have been found of other times as well. Normal everyday memories or those of boring activities can be found, but rarely, while memories of extreme feelings, such as happiness, are somewhat more common. Memories involving the mundane very frequently show up in places ravaged by the shadow plague. Even memories of still living survivors of the disease have been found. Unfortunately, due to the conditions of their minds, it was difficult to verify much of anything. It is possible that the disease creates memories as it destroys a drifter’s mind, but there is a lack of proper data due to its contagiousness, and its rapid processes.
	<br/><br/>
Memories also have notable medical uses for treating injuries caused by blight and shades. They can be woven into bandages to make “memory wraps”, which can be applied to injured areas to slowly return them to normal. While the symptoms themselves often disappear almost immediately, complete healing of the affliction may take an entire day. A full day of use will exhaust a memory wrap, leaving it nothing more than a tattered piece of cloth. The wraps can also be used for temporarily reducing the numbness of blighted limbs, but blighted limbs will exhaust the wraps as well. For a mental affliction, it is best to wrap the head. This will eventually restore a mind’s stability, and of course, exhaust the memories contained in the wraps. There have also been treatments involving memory salves or elixirs, but the effectiveness seems to vary from person to person.
