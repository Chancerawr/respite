	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	As the name suggests, the Komodo is a creature that bears great similarities to the Komodo dragon native to Pacific Islands.  While it appears to be a mammal and not a reptile, it is a quick, muscled, predatory creature with a hide that consists of highly resilient scales of a crimson color.  Komodos are exceptionally territorial creatures that are known to conflict with each other over their burrows, and will cannibalize one another for food.  They are known to mate and perform live births.  A female Komodo is usually larger than the males, and when in heat a female’s scales transition in color from crimson to black.  On average, male Komodos will grow to around eight feet in length and weigh approximately four hundred pounds.  Females will have a similar length, but will often be heavier to the amount of five hundred pounds on average.  This makes the male Komodo the more mobile of the sexes.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>INTERACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Komodo often sit at the top of the food chain in the respites where they operate.  As a result, humans and even plastics are viewed as prey.  They are highly intelligent creatures with keen senses of sight, smell, and sound.  A Komodo will rear up onto its hind legs when it detects potential prey, pivoting its head with its tongue out to taste the air and determine where its next meal resides.  When prowling this pivoting motion continues like a sort of radar to keep track of the scent of prey and maintain situational awareness of possible threats. 
<br/><br/>
	Unlike their reptilian parallel, these Komodos do not struggle to regulate their body temperatures.  As a result, they are possible threats to travelers at all times of day in most climates.  The Komodo are most commonly found in open plains areas that have soft soil and low scrub.  Also unlike their cousins, they are unable to climb trees.  As a result, elevation is one of the most ideal methods of positioning to defend oneself from a Komodo.  
<br/><br/>
	Due to their tendency to conflict with one another, Komodos have adapted to regenerate their ‘scales’ at a fair pace.  They will retreat to their dens to do so, but will emerge once the process is complete.  Often the scales still regenerate with scar tissue.  This is because, like the actual komodo dragon, a Komodo’s scales actually have a bone protrusion in each that behaves similarly to a shark’s tooth.  This makes them incredibly hardy against slashing attacks given the layering of the scales.  Bullets of course will still do the job, but older Komodos with firmer hides may be able to endure gunfire from smaller pistol calibers and even shotguns.  
<br/><br/>
	The true weapon that a Komodo has in its arsenal is not its keen senses, its intelligence, its sharp claws, or its firm hide, but its saliva.  Again like its cousin, the Komodo has a highly acidic and dangerous saliva that decays and eats away at the flesh of the victim.  Unless treated with a highly basic substance, this acid will eat away at the epidermis and dermis and make the victim prone to a deadly infection with a rapid onset.  In a sense, the Komodo functions a great deal like a viper, where it will bite at its prey a single time, retreat to a safe distance, and track it to wait for its slow death.
<br/><br/>
	<b>USES:</b>
<br/><br/>
	The stomach acid and saliva of a Komodo, if extracted with care, makes for a popular sterilizing solution for hazardous material.  Of course the saliva is hazardous itself, but it can rapidly break down and dispose of organic substances that are diseased.  
<br/><br/>
	The scales of the Komodo are incredibly intricate, and the hide itself must be removed very carefully to ensure that the creature’s bones remain intact. This hide is often most popular as a status symbol in clothing, as it rapidly loses its effectiveness in combat given that it can no longer regenerate.  Faux scales can and have been created by tailors to replace destroyed or missing ones.  Scales that are ‘organically’ damaged (referring to scar tissue rather than human-inflicted damage) are viewed to be more valuable.
