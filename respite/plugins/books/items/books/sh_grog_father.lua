The book itself appears to be written in a strange manner, lacking traditional paragraph and line structure."

		And so long as he lived, he never again wanted to be rich, or to change places, even for a moment, with the king.
	<br/><br/>
		A shade, born from the one some called
	<br/><br/>
		The Father, Him, God, The Shade
	<br/><br/>
		But confuse yourself not,
	<br/><br/>
		The ancestor of this shade was not the Judeo-Christian God
	<br/><br/>
		He was of men, and he became of blight.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		A shade, born from the one who became of blight
	<br/><br/>
		The descendant, generations of shades separated
	<br/><br/>
		Shared one of the powers of his forefathers
	<br/><br/>
		He possessed the power of life.
	<br/><br/>
		To give life to man.  Life to plastic.  Life to machine.  Life to faux.  
	<br/><br/>
		Life to death.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		His powers were a monstrosity to most.  
	<br/><br/>
		His former peers cast him out as a warlock.
	<br/><br/>
		Corrupted.
	<br/><br/>
		He wandered alone, just as his ancestor had.
	<br/><br/>
		He used not his powers, fearing the damage they caused.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		Life to those who need no more.
	<br/><br/>
		Flesh to those who need none.
	<br/><br/>
		Life to that which is not meant to be alive.
	<br/><br/>
		Life to that which has gone beyond humanity.
	<br/><br/>
		Life to that which was wholly devoid of it.
	<br/><br/>
		None of the parties deserved it.
	<br/><br/>
		So he gave none.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		So he wandered.
	<br/><br/>
		He arrived in a place of desolation.
	<br/><br/>
		Water, as far as the eye could see.  
	<br/><br/>
		Beneath the waves, a lost city.
	<br/><br/>
		In the distance, mountains.
	<br/><br/>
		And upon those mountains, men.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		Three, they numbered.
	<br/><br/>
		Lost, without understanding of their world.
	<br/><br/>
		Desolate of hope.
	<br/><br/>
		He pitied them.
	<br/><br/>
		He gave them each a gift to cast away this desolation.
	<br/><br/>
		To youngest of them, he marked them to create life from the faux.
	<br/><br/>
		To the middle, to create life from machine.
	<br/><br/>
		And in his erroneous ways, he gave the eldest the power to create life from death.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		Life to plastic.  Life to man.
	<br/><br/>
		That is all that remained.
	<br/><br/>
		The descendant, the Father of Life, realized his error.
	<br/><br/>
		In the hands of men, he gave the power of gods.
	<br/><br/>
		He doomed his children to the same fate he had endured.
	<br/><br/>
		One more son.
	<br/><br/>
		One to take the remaining pain.
	<br/><br/>
		To bear the burden.
	<br/><br/>
		To watch over the other three.
	<br/><br/>
		In search of his final son
	<br/><br/>
		He wandered once more.
	<br/><br/>
		---
	<br/><br/>
		He arrived in a place of desolation.
	<br/><br/>
		Wasted in lands.
	<br/><br/>
		Wasted in resources.
	<br/><br/>
		Wasted by war.
	<br/><br/>
		He wandered.
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		He wandered more.
	<br/><br/>
		And he came upon a grave.
	<br/><br/>
		Dug by the men who occupied it.
	<br/><br/>
		Who had become trapped in their tomb.
	<br/><br/>
		Bleeding.
	<br/><br/>
		Dying.
	<br/><br/>
		Two still lived.
	<br/><br/>
		One who still had their mind.
	<br/><br/>
		One who still had their body.
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		He turned two broken men into one.
	<br/><br/>
		His final son.
	<br/><br/>
		He gave unto them the power to give life to life,
	<br/><br/>
		And reserved an inheritance for his grandchild.
	<br/><br/>
		The final power.
	<br/><br/>
		To awaken when earned.
	<br/><br/>
		Just as his ancestor earned his title when he too awakened.
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		The four children of the descendant.
	<br/><br/>
		Descendants themselves.
	<br/><br/>
		Four brothers.
	<br/><br/>
		Now three.
	<br/><br/>
		In a world where the eldest
	<br/><br/>
		Spurns the legacy of the youngest.
