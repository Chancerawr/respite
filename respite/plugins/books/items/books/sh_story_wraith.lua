	Wraiths are one of the more rare creatures in the void, and will only appear in respites that also have drifters in them.
<br/><br/>
	Wraiths often appear ethereal, and generally have strange properties. One that is remarkably common is the body of the creature being entirely engulfed in flames. They are also known to be somewhat unpredictable, some moving at variable speeds. It is best not to underestimate a wraith, and to come very well prepared if it is necessary to combat them.
<br/><br/>
	Wraiths cannot be detected by creatures that do not have a consciousness. This means that abominations and some aberrations cannot perceive them in any way. Wraiths will also completely ignore anything that is not a drifter, or an ally of drifters unless directly harmed or impeded. These creatures are almost always hostile and mindless. When a wraith appears it will usually wander around the respite at random until it detects a drifter, or something else that can detect it. Before detection a wraith will act in a seemingly random fashion, wandering here and there without really appearing to search for anything at all.
<br/><br/>
	After detecting a viable target the wraith will immediately move to attack them. Different wraiths employ different tactics, most will simply move straight towards the target and attempt to incapacitate them, while others are more cunning and seemingly intelligent. It is not very difficult to confuse a wraith with an abomination, as they can be very similar in their actions. However, many differences arrive when they manage to incapacitate a drifter. When a drifter is incapacitated near them, they will seemingly reach into the drifter’s body, and begin to pull and tug at something within. This tugging and pulling is incredibly painful, but seemingly does no physical damage to the drifter’s body. When the wraith has finished this process, something with in the body seemingly gives way, and is pulled away. At this point, the drifter’s body will instantly turn into that of a husk, and the wraith will move on or disappear entirely.
<br/><br/>
	The speed of this process, commonly referred to as “huskification”, depends entirely on the drifter’s body, and how “human” it still is. A drifter whose body has more blighted, mutated, or otherwise replaced parts will expire faster than a fresh drifter with normal body parts. For a regular drifter, this process can take thirty grueling minutes. For a heavily blighted drifter, it may only take one minute. If the drifter is saved before the process is complete, the drifter will be completely exhausted, and have an intense feeling of emptiness for some time after the incident. They will eventually recover, but suicide and PTSD is quite common in those who have been victims of a huskification attempt.
<br/><br/>
	Wraiths do not take any more, or any less damage from either blight or shards. However, blue haze seems to distort their vision, and drifters have had success in using it to hide themselves from groups of wraiths.
<br/><br/>
	Many have hypothesized that the wraiths are returning the drifter to the real world due to the husks produced by them. However, there is no evidence of that being the case, and it is likely that wraiths are not so kind. Any drifters looking to wraiths to possibly escape the Void should be immediately dissuaded, as a fate worse than death may await them.
