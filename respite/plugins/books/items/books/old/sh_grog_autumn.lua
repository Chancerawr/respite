		Facsimile.
	<br/><br/>
		An exact copy.
	<br/><br/>
		Faux, fake, impure.
	<br/><br/>
		Memories, life, death.
	<br/><br/>
		We’ve told this story before, have we not?
	<br/><br/>
		I certainly have.
	<br/><br/>
		But, I neglected to tell theirs.
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		Plastics.
	<br/><br/>
		They are born here.
	<br/><br/>
		They die here.
	<br/><br/>
		There is nothing for them beyond here.
	<br/><br/>
		This is their home.
	<br/><br/>
		A world of perpetual decay.
	<br/><br/>
		Worlds and places where time does not pass.
	<br/><br/>
		Leaves do not change.
	<br/><br/>
		But they know nothing else.
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		What has not lived cannot die.
	<br/><br/>
		So what then is a plastic?
	<br/><br/>
		They live, and they die.
	<br/><br/>
		But they do so in a world without meaning.
	<br/><br/>
		Their lives have no meaning, just as ours do not.
	<br/><br/>
		Is that living?
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		They have emotion.
	<br/><br/>
		Family.
	<br/><br/>
		Friends.
	<br/><br/>
		Goals.
	<br/><br/>
		Humanity by all measure.  
	<br/><br/>
		They can be killed.
	<br/><br/>
		They can die.
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		Perhaps then, they do live, and they are living.
	<br/><br/>
		This is their home.
	<br/><br/>
		There is nowhere else to go.
	<br/><br/>
		They live and end here.
	<br/><br/>
		Spring, summer, autumn, winter.
	<br/><br/>
		All in one place
	<br/><br/>
		In a land without time.
	<br/><br/>
		--- 
	<br/><br/>
		They know not what they lack.
	<br/><br/>
		The change of seasons.
	<br/><br/>
		Feeling a world that lives around you
	<br/><br/>
		Rather than one that mimics life.
	<br/><br/>
		I envy them.
	<br/><br/>
		For they know not what they are missing.
	<br/><br/>
		And our hell is having hope for change
	<br/><br/>
		In a place that does not change.
