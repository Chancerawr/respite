Shades are a decently common creature in the Void, and have a wide range of abilities and strengths. Such variety has lead to some researches treating them as another branch of aberration. Whereas aberrations are created from blue haze, shades are created from blight.
	<br/><br/>
Shades have a variety of distinguishing features, some of which may not always be present. Most shades will be appear to be covered in blight, whether gaseous or liquid, the pitch black appearance is the standard for most shades. While sometimes appearing gaseous, generally most shades are to some degree solid, and will take physical damage much like other Void creatures unless they use an ability of some sort. The size of a shade varies, and seemingly has little to do with the actual strength of a shade as well. A large shade is not necessarily stronger than a more humanoid shade, despite being seemingly composed of more blight.
	<br/><br/>
All shades, being at least in some part composed of blight, desire it intensely. Blight allows their bodies to grow stronger and more powerful, and it also regenerates damage done to their bodies, as they do not heal at all without it. Shades without consciousness can easily be lured and drawn in by small amounts of blight, and more intelligent ones can have their interests piqued. It is for this reason that combat using excessive blighted weaponry attracts shades.
	<br/><br/>
Weaker shades behave fairly similar to abominations, and often shamble or sprint towards their enemies with reckless abandon. A shade such as this will attack using its own blighted body, using it to dissolve or corrupt whatever it is attacking until either it, or its target perishes. However, usually weaker shades are controlled by a more powerful shade, which can put a stop to these behaviors. 
	<br/><br/>
Stronger shades are more often than not, intelligent to some degree. However, intelligence does not always reflect the reasonability of such creatures. Typically the stronger the shade, the more unstable its mind. Shades of this type often have some sort of goal, but what that goal is can be anything at all. Generally conflict occurs when drifters are involved with that goal, or somehow stand in the way of it, even unintentionally. Shades are not known for peaceful resolutions, and typically spare no expense when pursuing anything they desire.
	<br/><br/>
Shades often have abilities that affect the brain or mental status of conscious creatures. Mind control, mental disorientation, possession, hallucinations, altered mental states, and many other dangerous abilities are all commonly used by more powerful shades. More intelligent shades have also been known to use blighted weapons in combat. The most powerful recorded shades seemingly have abilities that affect respites themselves, including even the time within it. Shades of this type should be avoided at all costs. With that being said, the abilities of a single shade can be incredibly difficult to determine at first. Therefore, any contact with a shade of any shape, size, or disposition should involve great caution, and an escape plan.
	<br/><br/>
Shades are not always immediately hostile, but are easily agitated in the most fickle of ways. There have been many cases of seemingly friendly shades luring drifters into traps, or stealing blight, and never being seen again. Some drifters have attempted to offer gifts or sacrifices to shades, in order to obtain peace, or power. These attempts succeed or fail based on the shade itself. Some may welcome gifts with open arms, while others take what they please and offer nothing in return. There have also been many instances of shades introducing conflict into groups through a variety of methods. A common trope is an offer of power at a price, or a stealthy meddling of minds to turn drifters against one another. The general consensus that activities such as create feelings of despair and nostalgia amongst drifters, which, in turn, can form blight within the respite. 
	<br/><br/>
Combatting a shade can be a difficult or easy task depending on the equipment available. Regular bullets and melee weapons will harm shades, but stronger shades can avoid their effects fairly easily by phasing their bodies or shielding themselves with blight. To avoid this, shards or shard dust can be used to enhance attacks to more easily cleave through blight, and prevent full phasing. Shades often utilize the darkness as well, as such flares, lanterns, and flashlights may be necessary if one truly wishes to deal with such a threat. However, lights created without the use of shards are subject to manipulation, which can allow a shade to blind a group of unprepared drifters fairly easily. Dark areas are best avoided without reliable illumination. Very powerful shades are notoriously difficult to kill entirely. They may hide within the darkness, within blighted limbs, or even within a simple vial of blight. Sometimes they may even warp to another respite, where they may eventually recover to strike again another day. Some beg for mercy, others offer promises of riches or gifts, but shade hunting drifters firmly believe that the safest option is always to kill, never to spare.
	<br/><br/>
Damage inflicted by a shade is often mental, with a variety of afflictions ranging from a simple headache to realistic hallucinations. These effects do not go away completely after the fight, and typically will remain until they are treated. Treatment for such ailments generally requires bandages with memories fashioned into them. A simple wrapping of the head will return the mind to its regular state after a mere few hours. Physical damage caused by a shade is generally in the form of a temporary blighted state, but is not less dangerous. While it can be repaired by wrapping the area in memory bandages, it is not quite as permanent as shadow limbs. However, enough of this type of damage will kill a drifter, and eventually turn them into a shadow statue, especially if the damage is focused around the head or brain.
	<br/><br/>
There are many ways that a shade can be created. They can be created by feelings of despair or nostalgia, and will appear randomly throughout abandoned respites with drifters within them. The more despair, the more shades will form. Shades formed like this are often weak, and unintelligent. More powerful shades are usually created either from a combination of much weaker shades, or from an intelligent being that was not previously a shade. Shade transformations are fairly rare, but account for most of the more powerful, intelligent shades seen throughout a variety of respites. This transformation’s trigger depends upon the creature being transformed, but typically involves great despair. More powerful shades can also create weaker shades themselves, either in battle or in preparation. Typically shades will use memories for this purpose, using it as a base, and then adding blight of their own to form a weak, willing follower.
	<br/><br/>
Shades can “steal” power from other shades in order to become stronger, this is generally referred to as siphoning. The relative strength of the shade determines how difficult it is to siphon, and a failed siphon can result in the attacker being absorbed instead. As a result, weaker shades will often work together in order to siphon a stronger shade, and split the obtained power amongst themselves. Shades can also consume, or merge with one another through a similar process. By combining, weaker shades can vastly increase their power, and become far more of a threat. Unintelligent shades will rarely do this on their own, and typically require some sort of push, or conflict to push them into action. 
	<br/><br/>
Bright sources of light can discourage shades from entering an area simply because it can limit their abilities and comfort in an area. Extremely bright lights can also agitate, and even damage weaker shades. That being the case, flares are useful tool for keeping small groups of weak shades away. Flashbangs are also incredibly useful, as they can completely stun a shade for a significant amount of time, freezing them in place as if they were a shadow statue. It is however, important to avoid relying completely on light. Large groups of shades, or more powerful, intelligent shades, can be agitated by a light within the darkness, and strike rather than cower. Nonetheless, it is common for travellers to always carry several flares with them when exploring darkened areas.
