“People say war is hell, I didn’t believe it at first but with the technology we have. I live and die in the same day and come back the next. Somedays, I just wish they would leave me there.”
-Unknown NATO Soldier
		<br/><br/>
A long gust of wind ushers out from above the desolate charcoal colored trees, it dances along the scarred bark before ceasing into nothing. What’s left of the trees in what was but a small park infested with children and their mothers not but thirty years ago is now but a silent wasteland. Laser scarred trees litter the stretch of land outside of a former playground, the slides and gimmicks of a traditional playground now but twisted metal and deformed melted plastic.
		<br/><br/>
The smell of corpses is now of a common fragrance of Eastern Berlin, it wasn't long ago that the capital city sat untouched by the flames of a third world war. Unfortunately, war is an ever moving and changing human policy and with the discovery of an alien aircraft of human origin, it was only to be expected the world powers that be would want such a lucrative piece of technology. NATO nor Warsaw ever thought about the consequences the war would have on mother nature, nor the scarce civilian populace that tried to live peacefully outside of constructed bunkers.
		<br/><br/>
It didn’t take long for a standing army to appear on both sides of the famed city, NATO and Warsaw Pact troops stormed the city from both sides. Anyone who was caught in between either made their way to safety or paid the ultimate price, even with a treaty in place a man may still use caution before firing but a artillery shell is ignorant of these practices. After a hellish battle that razed the capital and filled the streets with blood and sounds of the dying, NATO came out on top marking the first major win for the alliance.
		<br/><br/>
The sounds of the dying soon were drowned out by cheering and shouts of NATO soldiers as they celebrated, no one knew the last time they ever celebrated on the german front. This was in May, after months of fighting on the outskirts NATO fortified the city and hunkered down in trenches in strategic places outside of Berlin. Several months after in mid September another wave of reinforcements was dispatched from Berlin due east to meet up on the front lines.
		<br/><br/>
A dying heat sweeped the outskirts of Eastern Berlin as the early sun rises licking the roof tops of some buildings, the ones that still stand at least. The city streets covered in sandbags and emplacements, soldiers constantly running back and forth running supplies and errands while others sit in the street and converse, a crew of five or so man an artillery piece aimed for the giant gates that protect the eastern entrance. 
		<br/><br/>
The street smells of cheap cigarettes and of gunpowder, the whole garrison is on the buzz today as a rumor of a breakthrough passes by the ears of others. It started at the mess hall from a returning platoon and ended up spreading to other companies. Of course the officers say nothing of the matter but the enlisted act as if the red horde itself were upon their doorstep. A fireteam of about four soldiers enter the district as they begin to journey down the street, boots crunching the sullied ground beneath their feet giving no resistance to the group.
		<br/><br/>
“Oh hey so this is what undisciplined soldiers look like.” said the female soldier in the group, the woman was wedged between two larger looking soldiers with the largest one in front of the group. “Did I say break silence Private Bellia?” barked the soldier in a front a bit of a croak is heard from his throat as well, he was adorned with chevrons of a sergeant and a very scarred set of power armor. His equipment was in order and methodically followed the SOP as outlined for all infantry.
		<br/><br/>
“Wh- No you never called silence and it’s Ash to you Bentley, degenerate fuck!” she says barking rather loudly at her squad lead, soldiers who overheard the conversation stop what they are doing and turn their heads. Bentley stops walking, the man behind him unbeknownst of the immediate halt slams into Bentley. He drops his pen and journal, and kneels down and frantically goes to pick up his belongings. Bentley quickly picks up the man from the floor pushing him aside as he pulls off his helmet, tossing it to the ground.
		<br/><br/>
The man’s face is rather old as if his nanotec didn’t work to prevent aging. His skin is rather tanned and the left side of his face is disfigured, as a knot like scar twists around the left side of his mouth as if he were sucking his cheek in. His hair is grey and buzzed to a short length and his eyes are hazel like the trees before the war. He steps forward pointing to the woman “Helmet off, right fuckin’ now!” Bentley says to Ash in a raspy demanding tone, the two stand about five or so feet apart. She obliged as she takes off her helmet, her ginger ponytail falls out behind her head. The girl has soft like fair skin, light pink lips and blue eyes. 
		<br/><br/>
Most women who enlisted into NATO used the appearance changing abilities that nanotec possessed to change themselves cosmetics couldn't. In the future pharmaceutical corporations try to mimic this property with surgerys and small pre-war nanotec but fall short due to the vast technological distance between military and civilian nanotec.
		<br/><br/>
Ash throws her helmet at Bentley with quite some force as the crowd oogles her, Bentley blocks the helmet with his arms as he rushes forward throwing his arm back. He lets loose his limb as it soars forward striking Ash in the jaw, an audible crunch is heard as he dislocates her jaw. She jolts back bumping into the other soldier that was behind her as he begins to back up out of fear of being pulled into the fight.
		<br/><br/>
However, before Ash can recover Bentley grabs the woman by the throat before lifting her up to throw another punch. It strikes her left cheek crunching again as the bone snaps, she lets out a awkward loud cry of pain before Bentley tosses her. She falls rolling a bit from the soldier from before, he kneels down to her as his index and middle finger come up to her throat checking for a pulse. Meanwhile as the fight progressed a group of soldier ran off down the boulevard to the military police base in the middle of the district.
		<br/><br/>
The crowd cheers as Ash ceases to move “Bentley, Bentley, Bentley!” the soldier holding her begins to take out the medical kit on his back as he tries to nurse her back to consciousness. More and more soldiers begin to come to watch the scene unfold, the soldier who bumped into Bentley before approached him rather quickly as he writes frantically on his journal. 
		<br/><br/>
The soldier appeared to be quite lithe, his orange and white uniform hugs him tightly as if it were brand new. It was quite apparent he kept his kit and uniform in good order, he had quite a lot of gear on him as well perhaps too much for the average soldier. His corporal chevrons had a flicker of Ash’s blood on it as he had been in proximity of her before she was savagely beaten.
		<br/><br/>
“Sir - Sergeant Bentley, we do not have much time. It is quite obvious you have broken subsection 42a of Military Law of the alliance -” The corporal spoke with a slight british accent and in quite a nervous and frequent voice but was quickly cut off by Bentley’s angered voice and slight rasp. “Harrington I don’t need your academic report they gave me a stuck up bitch and I beat her in honorable combat. It’s justified, do you see any soldier reporting me? No, now shut your trap.” he said sneering at Harrington.
		<br/><br/>
“But sir the Eastern MPs have the highest arrest rate in Berlin this whole district is full of crime!” Harrington protests to Bentley as he shoves him away dismissing his claims. “If you can’t follow orders like you’re told Harrington you’re no good to me just like our friend here.” he says gesturing to Ash. Ash lies limp beside the medic who is still trying to tend to her wounds, it’s obvious she is alive however the medic is in a bit of a panic.
		<br/><br/>
Yelling and the sound of various scuffling come from outside the crowd from the boulevard, about twenty military police push their way through the crowd. As the soldiers begin to realize who just showed up the crowd breaks up, some of the MPs start grabbing some runners nearby them quickly disarming and detaining them.
		<br/><br/>
Bentley stands still where he is, Harrington beside him jotting along on his book. “Sir I think now is a good time to stand down?” Harrington says as he goes to tug on his uniform, his head turning to the group and back to the Sergeant. 
		<br/><br/>
The military police stand in rather different uniforms than the enlisted orange and white they stand wearing a navy blue uniform with red trimmings instead of orange. The leader steps out from his group, holding his hand up as some tried to follow his advance. 
		<br/><br/>
“Ah, Sergeant Bentley I think you’ve stepped into the wrong district again? Or have you not forgotten you’ve been transferred out? Is that why you’re starting fights again, I guess some never learn.” Says the commanding MP in a authoritative albeit snide tone, some of his men stifle a laugh.
		<br/><br/>
The men laugh a bit as the unoccupied part of the group begins to advance to the two, batons out as they fearlessly make their advance. The commander stands still as his subordinates begin to walk to Bentley and Harrington.
		<br/><br/>
“Sir please don’t.” Harrington meekly says
		<br/><br/>
“I’ve been waiting for this.” Bentley says as he cracks his knuckles
		<br/><br/>
“You’re joking right?” Harrington says looking back at Ash then Bentley.
		<br/><br/>
“No.” 
		<br/><br/>

<font size = '+2'>Chapter One</font>
		<br/><br/>
“It’s a brotherhood really, we all joined up expecting a quick war maybe see a few countries we’ve never been to before. Thirty one years later we’re still here, it’s given us a lot of time to know each other and I’m glad I’m here on the front, for a better future.”
-Corporal Jack Khadeer in a radio interview
		<br/><br/>
The lights flickers inside the dark holding area of the police base, a strong stench of testosterone plagues the cramped hallways like a gas attack of the first world war of long ago. Chatter and yelling come from the bars occasionally “Fucking let me out I didn’t mean to take it! Please for the love of god!” “Fuck you MPs you can’t hold us in here forever! You’re gonna be drinking your own fucking batons you shit heels!” screams some as others try to break down the bars of the cell but to no avail. Three men walk down the hallway, one men is obviously designated as a medic while the other two are armed military police. The group stops at a rather bleak pitch black cell, the lights that use to occupy it smashed with the occasional spark spurting from the live outlet.
		<br/><br/>
A audible sigh comes from one of the guards as he takes out a flashlight, shining it into the cell itself. As the darkness dissipates to the light of the torch, a hanging body is revealed to the group. The man appeared to be in his mid thirties with shaggy like brown hair, his body is pale and his wrists scarred heavily. His throat crushed by a snug collar of rope it extends up to the sprinkler where it’s tied. Beneath the man is various shards of glass covered in blood and a messy pool of blood and bodily fluids.
		<br/><br/>
“He cut his wrists, then hanged himself. That’s certainly new.” The medic said chuckling a bit to himself, he took out a soul spike uncapping the spike’s guard. He moves forward into the cell jabbing the soul spike into the man’s chest. He immediately begins to struggle against something although unclear what it is. The guards both start backing up to make distance, obviously a bit frightened. The prisoners scream and yell as they start to take notice of the guards. “Hey hey track boy, come over here!”
		<br/><br/>
“I’m hope you’re happy sir.” Harrington says to Bentley as he sits on the adjacent bed to him. Bentley’s face is completely swelled to the point where he cannot speak at all, Harrington sits in a orange jumpsuit while Bentley is naked from the waist up. His entire chest is bruised in various spots accompanied by deep cuts that are well on their way to healing. A large ball like cast is formed around his hands as Bentley grunts at him in response.
		<br/><br/>
The sound of a squishing pop is heard as the medic pulls the soul spike out of the man’s chest. “Killing yourself? I guess you forgot we can revive you.” He says speaking to the soul spike. One of the guards turn to the other, snapping his fingers to get the other’s attention. He mouths “Fucking crazy.” Before throwing his thumb over to the cell where the medic is in. The other guard smirks nodding in agreement.
		<br/><br/>
After a few moments the sound of the medic’s boots are heard smacking the hard concrete floor as he walks out the cell. The guards move aside as he goes to exit down the hallway while they dismantle the noose and carry the body out and away. Harrington let’s out a defeated sigh as he slumps up against the wall of the cell, he mimicks writing in a journal giving the man a smirk. “They even took my journal, when have words ever killed anyone or broken out prisoners? I really hate this district.” Harrington says letting out another sigh, his eyes looking up to Bentley. Bentley turns his swelled face away from Harrington as he looks at the small slit of a window.
		<br/><br/>
Sunlight streaks through the small barred window, it touches down in between the two soldiers and then some as it runs up along the bars of the cell. As if it were a small wall of hope the light continued to reach up the bars until it entered the poorly lit hallway and into the empty cell across the way. Both men stare at the light before it begins to recede pulling itself back into the cell, it appears morning had just begun.
		<br/><br/>
Ash got up off her own bed as she jumped up climbing onto the bars. “Hey you fuckers you better open this door or I’m - I’m gonna kick your ass!” she said screaming at the passing group. As she said this the medic stopped and turned to her cell, the two guards bumped into him. Both guards lose their grip on the corpse and drop it, the closest turned to grab the medic but was stopped by his partner “Do you know who that is? If you value both of lives you won’t stop him.” He says hissing quietly into his partner’s ear. “He already left we didn’t see anything.” He says now going to pick up the corpse from the ground, his partner grumbled something inaudible as he too bends down to pick up the corpse before they continue out the holding area. 
		<br/><br/>
The sounds of the rowdy and tortured prisoners seem to die down as the medic makes his return to Ash’s cell. He looks over to the man on the other bed before back to Ash. He takes off his helmet putting it down revealing his face, his eyes are stark blue and his hair is thick and bleach blonde and is rather nicely combed. He appears well built and his face is adorned with scars and stitches. He reaches his out inbetween the bars to her upper mid section. “Don’t worry, I can save you.” he mutters as a cold smile reaches over his lips as his gloved hand inches deeper towards Ash.
		<br/><br/>
She pulls back stepping off the bars and back onto the floor. “Let me out, I’ll show you something funny.” she angrily says gritting her teeth, her face glowing a light hue of red. The man pulls his hand back frowning a bit, a unnerving feeling washes over the two in the cell. The entire block stays dead silent except for the medic “I’m sorry, we’ll speak again. However, I must say I do love your hair.” He says picking up his helmet putting it back on, he begins to walk away tossing the soul spike in the air as he catches it.
		<br/><br/>
Eventually the feeling of awkwardness passes between the two as well as the block, the chatter and yelling start up once again. Ash turns towards the soldier that occupies the other bunk, the soldier is obviously taller than her however he seems rather scrawny and pale. His hair is light brown and his eyes green, he looks up at Ash biting his chapped lips. “You okay?” he asks in a concerned tone.
		<br/><br/>
“Am I okay? I don’t know John you tell me, the Sergeant breaks my face and then I almost got touched by a disgusting medic.” She says spitting a bit towards John, he let’s out a sigh as he looks out to the hallway. “If you keep causing shit and yelling I don’t think they’ll ever let us out, and besides I think we’re going to be court martialed.” he says looking down at his feet, avoiding her glare.
		<br/><br/>
“Fuck off commie.” She says to him before spitting on his boots. John looks up at her, his face filled between a mixed of anger and disappointment. He opens his mouth to say something but stops himself as he goes to look up at the window in their cell. The light traces the edges of the window bars but don’t so much pour into the cell as it did Harrington’s. Ash goes to the window pulling herself up, John’s eyes wander over to her but he turns his gaze back to his spit covered shoe.
		<br/><br/>
“I can’t wait to get out of here, the things I’m going to do to these stupid fucks. I don’t know if you know but they can’t keep me in here I’m a valuable soldier, I’ve done things like they asked me to. So we could win, so if they dare lay a fucking god damn finger on me - they’ll see what’s coming. I serve NATO faithfully and should be regarded as a hero not a criminal because my Sergeant punched me!” She says somewhat to the bars before she jumps down halfway to rant back at John who looks up to meet her steely gaze once more.
		<br/><br/>
“You know what Bellia - I mean Ashley why don’t you just go rest. Yelling and fighting won’t get us anywhere, we all know Eastern District is tough on crime especially recently with all the new lax COs in the companies. You’re lucky because we’re not suppose to off our guys anymore, unless the crime is a capital one. Besides these thugs are toeing the line with Central it’s only a matter of time before they switch battalions for the defence garrison and these guys will be off in Italy doing god knows what.” John says to her, however Ash isn’t really paying attention. 
		<br/><br/>
She sits down on her bed checking her face where her jaw and cheek were broke earlier. “No problem about fixing you up before.” John says, Ash doesn't respond but remains silent. “You’re the medic right?” Ash says to him “Yea.” he responds as he props himself up trying to make eye contact now with her. “Euthanize yourself pig.” she says spitting again at his face.
		<br/><br/>
He wipes the spit from his face, disgusted as her fluids violate him. “Whatever, bitch.” he says rather coldly as he goes to lie down on his bunk.
		<br/><br/>

The light from the window begins to change over time, the sun lowering leaving the block mostly without light as the lights that weren’t smashed or broken flickered lightly. “Mom….. Mom come get me out.” whimpers a poor soldier in one of the cells nearby Bentley. His face now significantly less swelled, the Sergeant retains his looks before the arrest.
		<br/><br/>
“I had to give them something to talk about didn’t it?” Bentley says to Harrington with a shit eating grin. “Sir - does your reputation really mean almost getting the lads executed? Harrington says leaning forward, he adjusts his glasses it as it straddles the edge of his nose before being reset to the top of it.
		<br/><br/>
Bentley let’s out a grunt at Harrington before he licks his lips to speak again in his raspy deep voice. “Harrington I didn’t ask for a pencil pushing pussy like you from Central nor the whore from South. The medic - Welstein from West is the only decent soldier I have. In any case, well let me make this simple to you. 
		<br/><br/>
My old squad was from east and most of them are gone now, one got captured by Warsaw. My god I hope he’s in a better place, one got a field commission and then disappeared from the company and one got arrested and court martialed for treason. How does that make me look? Makes me look like shit, command dosen’t look for improvement unless you are hero of the fucking alliance. If you’re shit you are shit, and well I have a bit of a reputation before I got transferred to deal with you idiots. Our first resupply and you all fuck it up.”
		<br/><br/>
Harrington interjects “Well sir you did start the fight.” Bentley responds with “I can still break your fucking skull with this iron ball around my hands now listen to what I have to say, interrupt me again you can eat my third nut you son of a bitch. I see a pristine opportunity to re-establish I’m not one to be fucked with and I take it, do you know what reputation is or are you too busy writing in your diary to pay attention to what people think of you?” 
		<br/><br/>
Harrington bites his tongue accidentally, blood pours out his mouth briefly. “Ammmuuh muuuh tongue!” he says going over to the sink spitting blood out. He turns on the tap letting out water as he goes to wash his mouth. Bentley begins to laugh out loud, he holds onto his stomach as he holds his head. “Ahahahaahah oh my - jesus christ kid the chances you’d fuck up that bad.” He says shaking his head as he begins to calm himself down.
		<br/><br/>
A pink color begins to fill Harrington’s face as he sits down once again across from Bentley, embarrassed he remains silent for about a minute. “If it’s about reputation than - what was with the MPs sir?” Harrington asks.
		<br/><br/>
The MPs moves closer to Bentley as he stands beside Harrington, Ash still out cold Bentley brings something out of his pocket it’s a official looking letter. “Hold on, McCormick I’m under orders from Central He says waving the letter, the MPs stop as they turn back to their commander. McCormick the witty leader of the group steps forward. “Oh really, let me see it.” he says in a pretentious tone as he closes the gap to Bentley.
		<br/><br/>
Sergeant Bentley hands the man the letter with a smirk, McCormick takes the letter. He opens it and takes out the piece of paper looking it over.
		<br/><br/>
“If you are reading this, you’re about to fucking die.”
		<br/><br/>
Before McCormick even has a chance to move back Bentley grabs the chicken shit of a MP by the throat and throws his fist into his mouth. A majority of his teeth are instantly blown out of his mouth, dazed but frantic McCormick tries to squirm and resist. “Somfudy facken hilp me!!” he blabbers as Bentley winds up again smacking him in the nose. His nose breaks and blood begins pouring down his face. The officer falls limp in Bentley's grip, the other MPs are discouraged as they begin to back up.
		<br/><br/>
Unfortunately for Bentley another group of MPs came to reinforce the existing one, about half a minute later the Sergeant was on the ground being brutally mauled by twenty MPs. Screams of agony echo the boulevard as Bentley is beaten to a bloody pulp by batons, boots and rifle stocks. Harrington, Ash and John are quickly picked up by other MPs and detained as well as the group found themselves in captivity of the Eastern District’s military police.
		<br/><br/>
“McCormick is something special, I’ll leave it at that Harrington.” He says with an exhausted sigh, Harrington shakes his head at Bentley. “I think we’re royally fucked sir, oh so fucked.” Harrington says with a tint of depression in his voice
		<br/><br/>
“Yea? What are they going to do, send us to the front? I think we’ll be here for a long time before they decide to do anything, the Colonel - Colonel Matwijec is too busy with his affairs to deal with a bunch of nobodies.” 
		<br/><br/>

“You’re going to the front.” Matwijec says to the group. The four soldiers sit down in chairs accompanied behind them is an armed guard of about twenty infantry soldiers. Matwijec office is quite small for a Colonel’s, it reeks of booze and cigarettes as old faded paintings of Nazi officials gather dust on the wall that seems to be sugar coated in filth. 
		<br/><br/>
The Colonel is wearing a officer’s uniform decorated in various medals, it’s about the only clean thing in this room. He has beady hazel eyes and a slicked back set of full black hair accompanied by a five o’clock shadow. Matwijec obtained Eastern District for his battalion after Central appointed him for his actions in Switzerland against Warsaw. His unit were outnumbered 20 to 1 but through his strategic brilliance he routed the enemy after they stepped into various home made traps and were hit by less than honorable tactics - not that Central knows.
		<br/><br/>
After his appointment he promoted various people to commissioned officers who didn’t do a great job discipling the defence garrison which led to lax rules and rowdy soldiers. The MPs at the time were under equipped and undermanned so as of recent, efforts have been made to train and equip more police in efforts to calm the ever growing problem of crime in the district.
		<br/><br/>
Matwijec toes the line with Central as they are close to transferring his battalion out of the district.
		<br/><br/>
“If I could have you all killed and get away with it, I would. I’d have every in that crowd axed and hanged.” Matwijec says with a angry rough tone, his words grind on his slowed speech. “But I will have you killed, you will go to the front lines and die there. You’re never seeing Berlin again, Bentley you came back and punch Captain McCormick. You are making this crime problem worse than it needs to be. I can’t even look at McCormick, he has no face you disfigured him his Nanotec is going to take a few days to fix his appearance now.”
		<br/><br/>
“However I’ve worked this out perfectly, if Central were to find out today was practically a riot in the street I’d be the one on the chopping block. Everyone arrested is going to the front, the ones who refuse are going to court - to die. I have you all on at least - twenty charges. You smug little shits. I’m going to make you all disappear.”
		<br/><br/>
“You’ll be wishing you were born Russian by the end of the week.”
		<br/><br/>

“I was never one to question what we were doing, we did what we were told to do. So what? We stopped communism you should be praising us as heros.”
-Pfc. Rico Lance during the Moscow Trials, 2073.
		<br/><br/>
Clouds begin to dissipate in the sky as the clear blue skies begin to expose itself to the ground below. The grass is rather green as the four walk behind their own lines, having left the giant nanotec door of the eastern district they walk east towards the front lines in full gear they trudge to the dirt road outside of the city’s borders. “It’s not faaaaaaair fuck this man” whines Ash as the group walks on the dirt road. Bentley turns his head back as if to say something but stops himself as he continues to guide the group.
		<br/><br/>
Harrington walks behind Bentley as he begins to write through his journal his head hanging down as he continues to walk. “Would you calm down?” Welstein says as he grabs onto her shoulder which Ash promptly shakes off. “No fuck off pig, I’m fine” she says responding with a grunt as she picks up her pace walking ahead of him. Welstein let’s out a sigh as he goes to look at the fortified walls of Berlin. “I don’t like it anymore than you guys but we sorta asked for this.”
		<br/><br/>
The environment slowly began to change as the group travelled away from the city, the ground began to feel more like scorched earth than just a dirt and gravel road as the four began to exit the safety of the Berlin area. Bentley continues to scan ahead as they travel onward as Harrington opens his mouth to speak “Do you think we’ll make it to the front? “ Bentley turns his head letting out a small grunt “I’m not gonna die before we get there that’s for sure.” The ground beneath them crunch under their boots as they travel.
		<br/><br/>
“I feel like something is watching us.” Welstein mumurs as he goes to check his railgun’s magazine. Up ahead on the road a large dead forest lay eerily undisturbed as the group headed in it’s direction. “Hey it’s deserters forest, we going there Sarge?” Ash sarcastically says to Bentley “Did I say talk?” Ash immediately closes her mouth. “No we’re not deserting you idiots, the frontline is on the other side of the forest.” Harrington interjects “Well sir couldn't we just walk around it or maybe the edges?” The three other soldiers laugh at Harrington “You’re a idiot corporal, it’s called saving time. We’re not pussies after all.” Ash jeers at Harrington who then closes his book.
		<br/><br/>
It’s not before long before the looming dead trees that use to harbor green leafs of life surround the group. They take a small trail heading through the forest as the sun begins to set, their is still a day or so of walking to do. As the night begins to attack the sky the group began to set up their camp in the woods, a fire is started and sleeping bags are laid out as the group settles down. Ash takes off her helmet letting her ginger hair breathe as the others began to do the same. 
		<br/><br/>
“We’re gonna ride this through” everyone raises their head looking up at John as he speaks. “Nothing a Colonel can do to us we can’t beat right guys?” He smiles as he looks up to the group, Bentley returns with a nod while Harrington begins to write again in his journal. Ash on the other hand seems rather disgusted as she begins to speak “Of course we’re going to survive don’t doubt us russian.” she snorts with unattractive laughter after her remark. “
