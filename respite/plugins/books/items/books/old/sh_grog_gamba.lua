	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Gamba is the term used to refer to an ‘aberration puppet’.  Gamba are often strange patchworks of a human.  The possessed is often disheveled in appearance due to a lack of grooming, and the only parts of their bodies that are maintained are the aberrated items and certain parts.  They are possessed by hive-mind aberrations whose common linkage to their wearer or master unifies them as they operate different body parts and functions.  <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>	
	<b>INTERACTIONS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Gamba are not hostile or docile by nature, but they obey the whims of the strongest aberration among them.  If the most powerful aberration is in some way violent or scornful by nature, the Gamba will likely be highly hostile.  There are some reported cases where the ‘crown’ aberration is hostile due to a resentment towards the duties it was provided with.  Aberrations that are employed as tools or that have a singular use are believed to be more likely to resent all forms of humanity (including plastics), and therefore will act accordingly.
<br/><br/>
	Drifters that have many haze limbs or adorn themselves with various trinkets infected with the hallucinogenic gas become increasingly prone to becoming a Gamba.  As a result Gamba are often what remains of more experienced, veteran wanderers of the respite whose quests for knowledge or curiosity ended in their complete corruption.  The possibility of becoming a Gamba is at its greatest when a chaos haze storm commences, as its hallucinogenic properties empower the worn aberrations while the cognitive abilities of the wearer are subdued due to hallucinations.  It should be noted that while humans are the most prone to being possessed, plastics are by no means immune.  Shades and the elusive Blight-Golems appear to be the only races that are an exception.
<br/><br/>
	It is nearly impossible to rescue a possessed individual from their status as a Gamba.  In order to accomplish this, each aberrated item or limb must be removed from the individual.  While no blood haze can be triggered by assaulting a Gamba (similar to an Empty), violently dismembering aberrated limbs from the possessed may trigger a mist after they are rescued.  Of course, this has not been tested due to the obvious risks presented by such an action.  In the few cases where an individual has been rescued, their cognitive ability rarely returns to a normal state and at times they either become comatose or enter a permanent state of psychosis.  Some believe that death is a mercy to these persons.  
<br/><br/>
	Gamba are a cautionary tale in aberrating objects that should be duly noted by those who find themselves combatting one.  At times combatants witness the many curiosities and trinkets the possessed bear and seek to take them for themselves.  It should be noted that if the aberrations banded together to overthrow the mind of the first wearer, they may easily do so again.
<br/><br/>
	<b>USES:</b>
<br/><br/>
	As noted, Gamba are often seen as walking stores of potentially valuable trinkets and supplies.  This does not diminish the dangers that those trinkets can pose.  However, there is a market for these trinkets among certain organizations with large research divisions.  More sinister buyers also exist who seek to gift or sell them to parties they particularly dislike.  Caveat emptor.
