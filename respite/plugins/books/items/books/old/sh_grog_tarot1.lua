	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b>
<br/><br/>
	For the uninitiated, “Tarot” is a substantial organization whose leadership is composed of 23 shades, to represent the 22 cards.  Despite the incredibly high number of shades present in the organization, they are designated with roles based on the tarot card that has been assigned to them.  Despite having distinct roles, not all shades are equal in the system.  Similar to the Cald, three shades lay claim to having authority over the faction.  These shades represent the Emperor, the Devil, and the Justice cards, and are referred to as the Balanced Powers. The remaining 19 are categorized as the “Eighteen Seats”. Fortunately, each of the shades representing the cards must adopt the name of the card, and therefore it should be somewhat easier to keep track of them.  It should be noted however that the nationality that the shade had in their nomadic form often determines the translation of the name. What follows is a brief description of each seat, starting with the Balanced Powers.  The remaining nineteen seats will be covered in a separate volume.
<br/><br/>
	<b>BALANCED POWERS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Emperor – Samraat (Hindi)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The emperor wields the authority of the executive branch over the faction.  This provides him with the ability to administer emergency powers to the Devil and Justice cards, while also being able to veto any actions they wish to undertake.  Traditionally he is a figurehead, though the original Asherian Role of this seat belonged to the eldest of the original tarots.  Despite this status, this seat is frequently responsible for facilitating diplomatic missions, arranging trade, and at times appearing to combat enemies of the state.  We believe that the current Samraat represents the second of the Emperors, and was the heir of the previous one some decades ago.  Traditionally, this seat is only occupied by males.
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Devil – Diavola (Italian)</i>
<br/><br/>
	The devil represents the legislative branch of the Balanced Powers.  This seat oversees the Tarot senate, an office that consists of twelve officials.  These officials are voted in to serve five year terms democratically by Tarot citizens with one stipulation: the senate must always have at least one senator representing each of the four “primary” races of Tarot, being humans, plastics, shades, and aberrations.  The Devil oversees senate activities and acts as a mediator.  They are also responsible for overseeing impeachment proceedings of any senators, or filling vacancies in the senate in the event of an emergency.  We believe that the current Diavola is the original one from the formation of the tarot, and interestingly she also has had the same heir-designate (who we also believe is her consort) for nearly eighty years. Diavola also serves as an emergency diplomat in times of crisis, and will often intervene in military affairs if the senate has approved them.  While she holds no official command, her abilities and unofficial authority gives her substantial sway.
<br/><br/>
	<i>The Justice – Justitie (Romany)</i>
<br/><br/>
	As the name implies, this official represents the judicial branch.  They act as the supreme legal authority in the land, though beneath them are multiple lesser courts and panels that decide on smaller crimes.  The justice may also block legislation from the Senate or overrule a veto from The Emperor should that legislation be deemed improper or damaging.  The current Justitie represents the seventh figure to hold that seat, and has been in her position for nearly the same time as the current Diavola. The turnover of this seat is attributed to infighting during the early years of the Tarot, wherein the original Justice seat was assassinated, and his subsequent heirs (Justices 2-5) were targeted by another faction.  Justice 6 was found guilty of embezzling funds from the faction’s legal claims accounts and was successfully impeached, with his powers being passed on to a human woman appointed by the Senate.
