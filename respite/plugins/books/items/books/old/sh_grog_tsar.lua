		[The paper is written like a scientific report describing the methodology of some kind of field testing for some kind of abomination being referred to as the “Tsar-Cough-A-Gas”.  It seems to be written by somebody named “Camden”.  The objective of the report seems to have simply been to analyze how the creature behaves in different situations, under the assumption that it holds shared traits with another abomination simply called “VE Type”.]

		<b>OBSERVATIONS</b>
	<br/><br/>
		Tsar-Cough-A-Gas (hereby referred to as TCAGT) appears to have the anatomy of the bleeder known as [VE TYPE].  Substantial differences between this creature and its cousin include those normally associated with “feral” [VE TYPE]. The specific differences are that the creature lacks tentacles and a protective carapace around its gas-producing sac.  This makes the creature substantially more vulnerable than the artificially adapted [VE TYPE] specimens developed in the past.  We believe therefore that this creature may be a derivation of both the ‘virgin’ [VE TYPE] in that it lacks any modifications and the artificial type, in that it retains the latter’s gas emittance ability.
	<br/><br/>
		This ability is still facilitated using a series of respiratory organs within the creature so that it may belch out the gas.  Testing indicated that when threatened the creature may swell up its bowels and expel a large amount of the substance to act as a smoke screen. Without tentacles, it is unable to accurately direct the gas like the adapted [VE TYPE] may, preventing it from manifesting ‘puppets’ of its own.  
	<br/><br/>
		With regard to temperament, we have found that it is still largely docile and just as skittish as the ‘virgin’ [VE TYPE].  While it has not developed any bone to defend itself from attack, this subspecies seems more preoccupied with avoiding confrontation in the first place and therefore has not adapted a response.  
	<br/><br/>
		[The observations continue for awhile, going into detail about various chemicals found within the respiratory organs that seem to be in line with those of the “VE Type”.  In meticulous detail, the writer lists the coloration and thickness of all of the various parts of the creature, from the skin down to the bones.  After the observations are complete, the report concludes by saying that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that this “TCAGT” is in fact a cousin of the “VE Type” and should be studied further.  Interestingly, there appears to be a conversation added as an appendix.]

		LF: “Camden, we uh… need to talk about that bleeder you found.”
	<br/><br/>
		Camden: “Certainly, what’s up?”
	<br/><br/>
		LF: “[Unintelligible] The name is fucking stupid.”
	<br/><br/>
		Camden: “W-What do you mean?”
	<br/><br/>
		LF: “Tsar Cough A Gas? What the fuck were you smoking when you thought that was a good name?”
	<br/><br/>
		Camden: “It is a good name.”
	<br/><br/>
		LF: “It’s a fucking mouthful.”
	<br/><br/>
		Camden: “It makes sense.  Tsar is king, cough is belching, and it belches…”
	<br/><br/>
		LF [interrupting]: “I’m not an idiot Camden, I know how the name works.  Just call it a [VE Type] two-point-oh.”
	<br/><br/>
		Camden: “But, that would imply it’s superior to…”
	<br/><br/>
		LF [interrupting]: “Anybody who reads the report knows it’s not, but it’s a derivation.  Just do it so it isn’t some stupid fucking pet name.”
	<br/><br/>
		Camden: “Yes m’am.”
