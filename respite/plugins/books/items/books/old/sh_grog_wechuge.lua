	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Wechuge are yet another creature whose name comes from some form of aboriginal legend in the real world, but it is thought that their origins are not monstrous in nature but rather anomalous.  The Wechuge are often viewed as guardians or protectors of coniferous forests and lands covered in ice.  They do not seem to be found in any environments that are warmer than those two biomes.  Furthermore, they are incredibly rare to find in areas that have been industrialized or developed by humans in the area, preferring to stick to the trees.  That being said, they are highly territorial and earned their ‘guardian’ status given that they seem to pursue those who cause damage to or exploit the environment for its resources.  They themselves are not known to consume anything, but their anatomy suggests some kind of photosynthesis.
<br/><br/>
	The Wechuge are large, proud creatures.  While not as towering as a Quadralex or Crucible, they are leaner and in some cases even longer, like large wolves. The structure of their bodies is rather canine in nature, but it also bears some resemblance to the skeleton of a bear, specifically in the shape of its skull and arrangement of teeth. The most notable feature of a Wechuge is its body composition.  Nearly all of a Wechuge’s body is made up of plant matter, with the vast majority of that matter being thick roots that are interwoven with one another.  In boreal environments, these roots may sprout lichen and moss in a manner similar to the [W] that give the creature a greenish color.  In snowy environments the roots may simply be a dull brown, like deadwood, or they may become encased in ice that gives them a sort of iridescent color.

	<b>INTERACTIONS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	A Wechuge can be an aggressive creature if it perceives individuals trespassing onto their lands as a potential threat to the environment.  It will usually rear onto its hind legs as the first warning to these trespassers.  Its second warning comes in the form of a howl.  The third and final warning that the Wechuge gives before it begins to pursue the intruders is it lets out a truly monstrous, even louder howl than before that is said to be strong enough to tear branches from trees and even cause avalanches.  
<br/><br/>
	The Wechuge is incredibly quick. While its weight can vary greatly given what kind of wood its body is made up of and what climate it is in, the speed of the creature gives its tackles enough force to destroy smaller trees in its path.  The length and size of the creature is often its weakness in wooded environments, as its size prevents it from easily navigating through a heavily forested area at great speed.  As a result, it is recommended that the best way to actually escape a Wechuge is not to run away from it, but to run perpendicular to its path of travel or to run towards it at a diagonal angle.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>USES:</b>
<br/><br/>
	A recent sighting of a Wechuge has warranted an addition to this report.  Known as a ‘Dead’ Wechuge, this particular variant was spotted in a wasteland area.  Reports from the team that spotted this creature say that ‘Dead’ Wechuges are easily identified by their grey and bare bodies, but should be avoided given that they are far more aggressive and easily provoked than their counterparts.
