		<b>ALIASES:</b> Craig Guthries (Actual Name), Crag, Eggy, The Bastard
	<br/><br/>
		<b>STATUS:</b> Living
	<br/><br/>
		<b>AFFILIATION:</b> Drifter Group 1996 (Formerly), Sand Sharks (Present)
	<br/><br/>
		<b>VISUAL DESCRIPTION:</b>
	<br/><br/>
		[Standard] Of Japanese descent, light skinned.  Body is almost entirely covered in armor, bandages, and other concealing accessories in order to mask substantial blight scarring (scarring believed to have emerged after ‘awakening’ in locations formerly masked by actual burn scars).  While concealed, his face is actually devoid of such scarring and is typical of a young Japanese male of his age.  
	<br/><br/>
		[Shade] Pinocchio’s appearance does not drastically alter from his ‘standard’ form.  The one exception is that when stressed, his eyes may fog up and become a dark-grey color, indicating that his blight levels may flare up in those situations.  His body does have a strange quirk where at times, particularly when tired or worn out, his appearance seems to almost flicker.  At times he has disappeared entirely, but has re-emerged unscathed at later points. 
	<br/><br/>
		<b>ABILITIES / COMBAT:</b>
	<br/><br/>
		As Gepetto’s second-to-last child, Pinocchio was granted the more trivial ability of memory.  This has proven to be both a blessing and a curse for the already psychologically compromised shade, as an excessive amount of memories in his system can put him in a catatonic state.  However, the ability to recall and access memories enables Pinocchio not only to mimic actions or remember critical intelligence, but also to learn different skills and abilities.  We have reason to believe that he has actually received the majority of Gepetto’s old memories, though he is unable to actually replicate shade abilities.  It should be noted as well that with great pains, Pinocchio can actually reconstruct memories within a Respite for others to witness and enter.  However, these memories can be unstable and require a substantial familiarity with both the event, space, and respite as a whole to be maintained.
	<br/><br/>
		Pinocchio is at his weakest when not present in one of his memories.  In those spaces, he can alter a location and its constraints to suit him, albeit at some cost of his energy.  Outside of them, he is limited to the abilities that fit a typical shade.  The one exception comes in the form of his two palms, which seem to be blighted and capable of paralyzing a foe in a manner similar to Jo.  However, this paralysis cannot be issued remotely and requires direct contact between the hand and the forehead of the target, implying that this is likely an adaptation of Gepetto’s ‘memory surge’ ability.  This particular ability only seems active in the physical space.  Should the need arise, Pinocchio is likely able to be easily dispatched by an Alpha Shade. For our purposes, this means that he is a highly vulnerable target.  His primary methods of defense are essentially ‘turtling’ within a memory, though that can only be done for a limited amount of time before he is too worn out to continue.  Otherwise, he does have a fair understanding of firearms and, strangely, incredibly fluid mixed martial arts skills.
