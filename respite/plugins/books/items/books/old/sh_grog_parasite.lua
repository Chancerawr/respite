	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	A somewhat new denizen of the Respites, Parasites are creatures that feed off of living beings. Specifically, they are ‘abomination limbs’ that have somehow gained the ability to grow over and overpower the human they are attached to.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>INTERACTIONS:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Identifying a Parasite may be difficult depending on what limb the abomination originated from.  If the abominated organ or extremity in question was not an appendage, a Parasite may be difficult to discern from other humanoid forms of abomination.  Generally humans plagued by these Parasites have had their bodies become covered in sores, with their flesh becoming raw and red.  The original abominated body part will have usually grown as well, at times to astonishing proportions compared to the rest of the body.  
<br/><br/>
	Naturally a human being fed upon by a Parasite has lost their ability to control themselves.  For all intents and purposes, they are dead.  Attempting to come to the aid of a Parasite to ‘separate’ the parasitic flesh from the actual body is ill-advised; dissection of available specimens has found that the abomination limbs and flesh fuse together with the human body.  
<br/><br/>
	Exactly how a Parasite is born is uncertain.  No cases have been reported from those who have witnessed a drifter undergo a full mutation.  Usually the limbs that are not tampered with are kept in check by the wearers and should not overpower them.  The only hint to the origins of the Parasites comes from the faint traces of blight detected in samples of flesh.  The blight seems to infuse itself with the cells of the abominated flesh, and appears to also be responsible for the fusion of monster and man.  Initial assumptions regarding the origins of these creatures posited that they were the result of substantial exposure to shards.  Lab tests have proved inconclusive at best, and generally point to shards having an inert effect on the flesh despite the fact that traditionally shards empower abominations.
<br/><br/>
	Combat abilities vary as widely as the characteristics of the abomination limbs.  However, Parasites tend to be rather sluggish due to the oversized and bloated nature of some of their appendages.  Unlike other abominations, their anatomy also is more representative of a traditional human and they may be easier to dispatch as a result.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>USES:</b>
<br/><br/>
	The difficulty that comes with identifying a Parasite has made acceptable samples rare.  It is also thought that they are not very numerous either because the circumstances required to create a Parasite are difficult to arrive at or because they are weak and easily exterminated.  As a result several organizations have active bounties on corpses for these creatures, the largest among them being the Tarot.  The holder of the Strength card should be contacted for question on this.
