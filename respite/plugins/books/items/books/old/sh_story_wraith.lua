Wraiths often appear ethereal, and generally have strange properties. Some may be perpetually on fire, while others are coated in a thick layer of ice. They are also known to be very unpredictable, some moving at variable speeds. It is best not to underestimate a wraith, and to come well prepared if it is necessary to combat them.
	<br/><br/>
When a wraith appears or is created in a respite, it will typically search for drifters in its immediate area. If it does not find any, its behavior will become erratic and unpredictable. Some may seek to create more wraiths, while others will do any manner of seemingly meaningless activities. Much of the thought process of a wraith is still up for debate, most believe that they are similar to abominations, just in that their prime directive is focused on drifters. However, their idle activities, though mostly meaningless, implying that there could be something more than a mindless creature. 
	<br/><br/>
These creatures are hostile against all other forms of life in the Void, though generally will prefer to target drifters if they are present. Upon encountering most creatures, such as abominations, or aberrations, they will attempt to either destroy the creature, or assimilate it into a wraith through the use of excess ichor. However, they will not go out of their way to perform such a process, searching for drifters is generally their highest priority at an instinctual level.
	<br/><br/>
After detecting a drifter target the wraith will immediately move to attack them. Different wraiths employ different tactics, weaker wraiths will simply move straight towards the target and attempt to incapacitate them, while others are more cunning and intelligent. It is not very difficult to confuse a wraith’s behaviors with that of an abomination, as they can be very similar in their actions. However, many differences lie in the method of their attacks. A wraith’s attacks can be simple physical attacks, such as searing hot claws, frozen body parts, or even wielded objects, but all wraiths have one form of attack distinct from all other Void creatures. Often used when a drifter is incapacitated near them, they will seemingly reach into the drifter’s body, and begin to pull and tug at something within. This tugging and pulling is incredibly painful, but does no visible physical damage to the drifter’s body. When the wraith has finished this process, something with in the body appears to come loose, and is pulled out by the wraith. At this point, the drifter’s body will instantly turn into that of a husk, and the wraith will change somehow, and become more erratic and strange. 
	<br/><br/>
The speed of this process, commonly referred to as “huskification”, depends entirely on the drifter’s body, and how “human” it still is. A drifter whose body has more blighted, mutated, or otherwise replaced will expire faster than a fresh drifter with normal body parts. For a regular drifter, this process can take thirty grueling minutes. For a heavily blighted drifter, it may only take one minute. If the drifter is saved before the process is complete, the drifter will be completely exhausted, and have an intense feeling of emptiness for some time after the incident. They will eventually recover, but suicide and PTSD is quite common in those who have been victims of a huskification attempt. Memory wraps are a common treatment for this affliction, and are generally effective almost all of the time.
	<br/><br/>
Shards will destroy wraiths similar to how they destroy shades, seemingly destroying the material they are made out of, that being ichor. This can corrode a shard given enough use, but is typically thought of to be the most efficient way to take care of a wraith. Some find it even being worth carrying in areas known to contain abominations, just in case.
	<br/><br/>
Blight, when reacting with wraiths, will cause a shockwave, damaging anything nearby. This is because wraiths are made out of, or at least in some way contain, ichor. Fights between wraiths and shades essentially become nothing more than an sequence of shockwaves and blasts until one of, if not both of the creatures are destroyed.
	<br/><br/>
Blue haze acts as some sort of blockage in a wraith’s perception. Wraiths cannot sense anything past or through it in any way. Many drifters use this fact, and coat themselves in blue haze in order to sneak past wraiths when necessary. However, blue haze is easily assimilated by ichor, and thus it is unwise to attempt to blind wraiths by throwing blue haze at them. While it may blind them for some time, it will also increase most likely increase the size of the wraith, or produce more wraiths.
	<br/><br/>
Many have hypothesized that the wraiths are returning the drifter to the real world due to the husks produced by them. However, there is no evidence of that being the case, and it is likely that wraiths are not so kind. Any drifters looking to wraiths to possibly escape the Void should be immediately dissuaded.
