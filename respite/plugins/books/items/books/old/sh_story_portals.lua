Portals are a relatively common occurrence in most abandoned respites. They are usable by all things that can travel through them, and can appear randomly or be created by specific circumstances.
	<br/><br/>
A portal is defined as any surface or material that transports one object to another location. Most portals generally do not lead to other respites, but there are plenty that do. Usually once a portal is established, its exit will not change unless it closes, but this can depend upon how it was created. A portal created by a living being may have the ability to change the destination while the portal is open.
	<br/><br/>
Physically, most portals appear to have a colored outline, and a blackness everywhere else. They come in a variety of shapes, from doors, gates, holes, cracks, etc. The  color of a portal may also vary depending on the nature of its connection. Most consider red portals and black portals to be dangerous, while white portals are somewhat neutral. It is wise to avoid red portals, especially jagged, crack-like ones, as they are typically an indicator of an abomination threat.
	<br/><br/>
Many devices in the Void make use of portals in how they function. The requisition device is a common portal device, as it actually opens portals in the sky above to provide requested supplies. Other more simple devices may have a small portal within them open at all times, which can be used to transfer input and output objects around. Devices such as a chip pouch, or an enhanced backpack make use of portals to create extra space.
	<br/><br/>
Enhanced chips are vital for most technological uses of portals, and can easily be applied to most objects in order to give them portal-like properties. Ammunition is a common, yet expensive implementation of this fact. Portal enhanced weaponry becomes incredibly good at penetrating through armor. This is not because it is higher velocity, or more powerful, but because it teleports the material it makes physical contact with somewhere else. That being the case, portal bullets lose some power, instead of blowing things apart, they leave bullet sized holes. Portal enhanced melee weapons also work in a similar manner. A portal blade will teleport what it cuts somewhere else, making it seemingly very sharp. However, portal enhanced weapons, with enough use, will lose effectiveness, and eventually return back to normal. 
	<br/><br/>
Many powerful creatures of the Void, such as strong aberrations or shades, have the ability to open up portals themselves. Even some abominations are capable of creating portals, but typically these are not seen unless in a very severely infested area.
