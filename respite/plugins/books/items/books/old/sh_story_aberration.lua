	The term ‘aberration’ refers to a category of living creatures in the Void. These creatures often vary wildly from one to the other, and can be very hard to categorize. Aberrations can be mindless or intelligent, aggressive or passive, numerous or unique. There are seemingly no limits on what an aberration can be, the only necessary qualification is that they were created in part by blue haze.
<br/><br/>
	The powers of aberrations range from useless to godlike, some aberrations can do nothing at all, while others can change the laws of physics or warp space time. It is impossible to know beforehand making it is important to not act rashly when dealing with any aberration. It is best to never judge a creature solely by its appearance, and to tread carefully around any strange creatures.
<br/><br/>
	Many have described research into aberrations as “impossible” or “ridiculous”, and they would be absolutely correct. Aberrations are an enigma. They are chaotic, sometimes nonsensical, and often times logic defying. Not only their forms, but their behaviors, their actions, their creation, everything about them is in essence, unreasonable.
<br/><br/>
	Aberrations and abominations share many similarities, at least in how they react to most substances in the Void. Blight dissolves them like acid, ichor attempts to infest them and turn them into wraiths, and shards mutate and enhance them into creatures that are not quite the same as they once were.
<br/><br/>
	Blue haze is the key creator of an aberration. All things that are considered aberrations will have been involved with blue haze at one point in time. It heals their injuries and repairs their bodies, and if enough of it is gathered at once it can even grow and enhance them. However, many aberrations seemingly pay no mind to blue haze at all, as if they have better things to do. Fortunately so, as an aberration’s threat level can rapidly increase if it has access to enough blue haze.
<br/><br/>
	Not only are the creatures themselves strange, but so are many circumstances surrounding them. The most notable anomaly is the strange fact that drifters almost never encounter some of the supposedly ridiculously powerful aberrations that “should” exist. Such creatures are mostly known about due to reports from plastics, and from evidence left behind in abandoned respites. Creatures larger than the sky, more powerful than gods, and completely beyond any regular human understanding. But nonetheless, they are almost never encountered by drifters in any sort of number. The rare drifter reports of such creatures were only seen when only a single drifter was in an abandoned respite, and had been there for an extended period of time. This phenomenon could be attributed to the aberrations themselves, as if they were simply avoiding drifters in general, but with the little that is known about these creatures, it seems unlikely that all of them would have the mental capacity for such an action. 
<br/><br/>
	There is one mostly consistent type of aberration that, by nature, will often end up interacting with drifters. These aberrations can be referred to as “copies”, as they are simply aberrative replications of human beings. Since they are replications, they are for the most part, completely human, but there tend to be strange behaviors that differentiate them from regular drifters. These anomalies can be any manner of aberrative nonsense, and such are also completely unpredictable and seemingly random. However, since the creature is not truly a drifter, it lacks some elements of what makes a drifter, a drifter. The easiest indicator is the effects of blight on the creature’s body. Since it is an aberration, blight will dissolve the creature like a strong acid. Copies often show up after the deaths of popular drifters, as if they were simply brought back from the dead. However, situations are generally made more complicated when it is revealed that their memories or personality may have changed completely. For some, these aberrations are welcome members to a group, while to others they made a crime of nature, and immediately destroyed.
