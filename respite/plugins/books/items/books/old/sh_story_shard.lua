Shards are a crystalline type of material that has both useful and dangerous properties. It is highly sought after by drifters, and feared by shades.
	<br/><br/>
The substance that makes up shards is attracted to anything else made of the same substance. The strength of this attraction depends on how much of the material there is. This trait makes it particularly easy to merge shards together, which is necessary for the construction of a respite orb. However, it can also lead to inconveniences in storage and in usage, as once a shard merges with another shard it is difficult to separate it. Shard material also ambiently generates light which also depends upon how much of the substance there is. 
	<br/><br/>
Shards come into existence naturally when drifters spend a lot of time in an area. This is thought to be linked to the creative powers that all drifters have. Typically the rate of shards appearing in a respite is very small, but there are exceptions. Generally around large groups of drifters there are sometimes large crystals of shard material seemingly jutting out of the ground. Due to properties of the crystal, it cannot be broken apart and harvested easily, making explosives a necessity for anyone who wishes to harvest it. Unfortunately, much of the valuable resource is lost through this method, making it somewhat inefficient.
	<br/><br/>
Upon making contact with abominations, or aberrations, shard material is absorbed, and the creature itself will undergo changes. Both abominations and aberrations will mutate into a more disturbing form, and become more aggressive. A mutated aberration will lose much or all of its sanity, making it a dangerous threat. In such a case, it is wise to think of the mutated creature as a new abomination, rather than what was once an aberration. When a mutated creature is slain, the shard material can be extracted from their corpse, and can almost always be found in the approximate center of the creature. 
	<br/><br/>
When ichor or blight make contact with a shard, the portion of the material touching the shard is destroyed. This applies in the case of shades and wraiths as well, making weaponry based on utilizing shards or shard dust particularly effective against them. That being said, it will not instantly destroy any shade or wraith that touches the blade, but it will significantly damage them in a way that is difficult to regenerate without the addition of more ichor or blight. However, that does not mean putting shard dust on any object will make it a potent weapon against shades or wraiths, as it is more of an enhancer rather than the primary method of damage. Many foolish drifters have died trying to fight shades with infused sticks and stones.
	<br/><br/>
When plastics make contact with a shard physically, the plastic is changed fundamentally into a different creature, generally a blood fiend. This is the primary reason that plastics avoid touching shards, and find them somewhat “holy”. Using shard infused weaponry on plastics will have the same effect. For the sake of any plastics in the area, and for yourself, it is best to avoid creating fiends. 
	<br/><br/>
Abominations are attracted to shards, even if they cannot see them. This makes carrying shards into abomination infested areas a somewhat poor idea. While some still do it regardless, it is important to consider the risks, as an abomination that manages to make contact with any shards a person is carrying will become far stronger than before, and immediately make itself a threat to anything nearby it.
