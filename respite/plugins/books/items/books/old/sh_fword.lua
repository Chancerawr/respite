<font size = '+2'>M</font>ommy!' my son cried out as he ran into the room, 'Cherish just said
the f-word!' I set my book down, took his hand and asked, 'What is the f-word?'

He looked around the room. 'It's okay to tell me, honey.'
Meeting my gaze, he shrugged, 'It's 'Fuck!'

I squeezed his hand and called to his sister's bedroom, 'Cherish,
come in here. Right now.'
