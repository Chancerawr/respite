ITEM.desc = "A somewhat large book of few pages.  It resembles a children’s book in terms of size, but the quality of illustrations on the cover and interior pages, along with the language used, suggest it is directed for adults.  The cover simply reads ‘Terror’ in black font on a plain white background.  For each page there are only one or two lines of text, and each is coupled with some kind of abstract illustration."

		We were born to fear death. To believe that was the worst that could come of us.
	<br/><br/>	
		We were wrong.
	<br/><br/>
		What of a life where we have not lived?
	<br/><br/>
		A life we know.
	<br/><br/>
		Parents and siblings.
	<br/><br/>
		Friends and lovers.
	<br/><br/>
		Memories and experiences.
	<br/><br/>
		They all never happened.  But we think they did.
	<br/><br/>
		We live lives of lies.
	<br/><br/>
		All that is good.  All that is bad.
	<br/><br/>
		It wasn’t real.
	<br/><br/>
		It isn’t real.
	<br/><br/>
		We lie to ourselves, because they lied to us.
	<br/><br/>
		Nobody told us it was not real.
	<br/><br/>
		We had to find it out ourselves.
	<br/><br/>
		I’m sorry you are here.
