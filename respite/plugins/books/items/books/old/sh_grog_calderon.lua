		<b>ALIASES:</b> Jose Calderon, Big Brother, Soulkeeper, Hades, Mistwaker, El Gobierno, Cald1
<br/><br/>
		<b>STATUS:</b> Living
<br/><br/>
		<b>AFFILIATION:</b> Cald (LEADER), Shark Separatist & Cald Coalition (LEADER, Present)
<br/><br/>
		<b>VISUAL DESCRIPTION:</b>
<br/><br/>
		[Standard] Calderon is the only member of the Cald Trio of shades that actually has an appearance not entirely consumed by blight.  He is often clad in a full custom combat uniform designed for the cold environment of Cald territory.  This means that there is no visible skin on his figure.  He often sports a gas mask, though whether it is necessary for his survival or simply an accessory is unknown.  It does however conceal many of his features.
<br/><br/>
		[Shade] The ‘blighted’ form of Calderon is typical of an ‘unleashed’ form, though it does not seem he requires substantial blight to ‘activate’ it.  In this form, Calderon’s body becomes engulfed in his signature gray gas.  This would obscure him entirely if not for the two glowing black objects within the gas that seem to represent his pupils.  While Calderon can reduce the gas and make himself more visible, in actual combat situations he is unlikely to show quarter.  Should he actually reduce the concentration intentionally, he is either saving energy or toying with his opponents.  
<br/><br/>
		<b>ABILITIES:</b>
<br/><br/>
		[Shade] The names Soulkeeper, Mistwalker, and Hades were all found in writings cataloguing various encounters with Calderon by different parties.  In all three cases we located a name, the name was provided by plastic tribes that had witnessed some kind of action by Calderon against another party.  These names explain his primary ability.  Religious text, field reports, analysis, and anecdotes all indicate that Calderon was given the powers to be ‘death incarnate’.  While this may seem like a dramatization of facts, the gray gas that surrounds him appears to provide life to the dead and simultaneously rot anything else.  Combat encounters between Colossus and Calderon in particular indicate that he can be either indiscriminate or discriminate as to what his gas affects, suggesting he has full control over the substance as though it is an extension of his body.  Furthermore, this suggests that the “Empties”, which use a derivative of his gas and were created by the Cald Trio, could potentially be controlled by him if he so wished.  As a result, we believe that even in situations where Calderon may seem alone, he can likely bring reinforcements rapidly. 
<br/><br/>
		We do know that the gas that Calderon produces is blighted.  The gas is not only projected from his body, but also a custom derivative of the CH-AFE flamethrower that condenses the gas into a jet rather than igniting it.  In engagements with Colossus, the gas was found to decay flesh at about the same rate as his regeneration, suggesting that perhaps Calderon does have a limit as to exactly how much gas he can harness.
<br/><br/>
		<b>COMBAT:</b>
<br/><br/>
		This shade should be avoided at all costs.  No exceptions.  Weapons can be easily destroyed by him, and even sharded bullets or other weapons seem to decay when confronted with his particular strain of gas.  We only believe that other Alpha Shades can possibly contest him.  His skill level is about on par with that of Colossus and Boneca, but his abilities supersede theirs.  Based on what we know, we believe that only Gepetto would be able to prove more than a match for this shade.
