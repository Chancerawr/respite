	Testing on the captured creature identified as the “Quadralex CD+” has been concluded. The following differences between the ‘control’ creature and its “CD+” variant were identified.  
<br/><br/>
	OBSERVATIONS:
<br/><br/>
	1) Exterior flesh of the creature more rigid.  We know these creatures to already boast substantial resistance against attacks of all kinds due in large part to their armored carapace, but the pale white flesh that covers the muscle of the creature took on a stone-like appearance.  Interestingly, stratum was visible in this new flesh.  Strong possibility that visible stratum is dependent on the origin of the sediment used in the steroid.  
<br/><br/>
	2) Substantial increase in defensive capabilities.  The increased rigidity of the flesh of the Quadralex following exposure to [controlled substance] has enabled it to stave off the high-penetration weapons that are commonly used to dispatch its less developed brethren.  However, testing on various parts of the body with different weapons have revealed that concentrated, rapid fire may be more effective than single, accurate shots.  Just as with stone, repeated shocks and physical trauma concentrated on one section of the flesh have a tendency to cause fractures in the stone.  Fractured limbs are subject to a self-reinforcing effect when damaged in that they shall fracture even more at an even faster rate than a ‘virgin’ limb.
<br/><br/>
	3) Mobility shift.  The “CD+” variant of Quadralex struggles far more at acceleration than its brethren that have not been exposed to [controlled substance].  However, we attribute this reduction in acceleration to an increase in mass thanks to the change in biological construction.  While acceleration has dropped, the increase in mass relative to the loss in acceleration is such that a Quadralex CD+ possesses far greater momentum than its brethren.  We have not been able to confirm this with concrete testing (in the literal sense of having this creature charge into a block of concrete) due to the loss of the specimen following explosives testing.
<br/><br/>
	4) Fragmentation.  Use of explosives against this creature is ill-advised.  Detonation of high explosives on creature resulted in substantial shrapnel ejected from flesh in all directions.  No wounds were accounted for among testing personnel, but in combat conditions this could prove to be lethal.

	[What follows are pages discussing the nature of the tests and how they were performed, in excruciating detail.  Every fact from the quantity of tranquilizer used in the drugged meat to the caliber and quantity of ammunition fired at each individual limb have been accounted for.  The report closes with a disclaimer on the final page…]
<br/><br/>
	NOTE: Extent of corruption by [controlled substance] may varied based on environment within particular Respites.  Respites subject to substantial injection of [controlled substance] may possess more potent specimens.  Therefore, the findings of this report may not be totally accurate as new variants emerge.
