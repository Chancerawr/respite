	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>	
	Crucibles are territorial creatures that often reside in dark, subterranean environments.  They will ignore human activity despite their territorial nature, unless those humans are infringing upon its ‘mining grounds’.  Crucibles are fairly rare in the wild, but seem most common in colder and drier environments.  They are large creatures that do not grow fur, but some comparisons have been made to the Megatheriums that existed on Earth during the Pliocene period.   The comparison to the ground sloth is apt given their claws and slow yet deliberate movements.  As those who have experience with sloths know however, their sluggish behaviors can rapidly change to something incredibly dangerous and threatening should they be angered.  Quadralex that enter the territory of a Crucible can be overpowered by its combination of sharp claws and strength capable of splitting stone.  It is believed that Crucibles actually consume rocks and other minerals, including shards, and cannot be classified as carnivorous, herbivorous, or omnivorous.  Their stomachs are incredibly thick and leathery, with extreme resistance to heat.  Chemical deposits found in their stomachs suggest that their digestion process begins with an incineration of any ‘waste’ that cannot be consumed, followed by a digestion of the material that is left using a potent stomach acid.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>INTERACTION:</b>
<br/><br/>
	Crucibles should not be interacted with directly, but they can be watched from a somewhat close distance and studied in that manner.  They are somewhat intelligent creatures, and may grow accustomed to human contact if the humans provide them with offerings of shards or other minerals.  One myth from a plastic tribe claims that a creature described to be quite similar to a Crucible helped to prevent any corruption by shards due to its ravenous consumption of that material.  
<br/><br/>
	Should confrontation be unavoidable, it is wise to be in a constant state of movement.  The Crucible is an incredibly strong and hardy creature, and it can readily eliminate any height advantage an opponent may have over it either by climbing up or destroying its position.  The front claws should be avoided at all costs, as each paw essentially functions like a berserker wielding two greatswords with astonishing speed and precision.  When dealing with a Crucible that remains confined to a cave system or any subterranean environment, certain explorers from various factions suggest that they can be blinded or distracted by large amounts of light temporarily.  This should provide ample time to escape.

	<b>USES:</b>
<br/><br/>
	With an incredible amount of sedatives, a Crucible can be captured.  They do not function well in captivity (they often grow angry and restless), but placing them in ‘simulated’ captivity will often keep them docile.  An example of simulated captivity that has proven incredibly effective is employing them in quarrying, tunneling, and mining operations.  The strength of these creatures enables them to break through rockfalls and rapidly cut through stone in a fashion similar to industrial machinery.  Given that they happily consume the unusable slag that is produced from these operations, they require little overhead to use in this fashion.
<br/><br/>
	Deceased Crucibles are highly sought after for their fat, claws, and stomachs.  The flesh of the creature is incredibly firm and nearly impossible to chew.  Even then, it lacks flavor.  While the fat of the creature is nothing special, it is present in sufficient quantities that it can be rendered into a large supply of oil and candles.  Unlike the meat, the fat is also able to be used in cooking, though it is most suited for use in stews and chowders.  
<br/><br/>
	The claws and stomachs are oft sought for use in combat environments.  The claws are large, heavy, and unwieldy.  As a result, deployment with swordsmen is ill-advised.  However, the claws have found a use as battering rams when attached to various war rigs.  In some cases they are used as plows for tilling fields as well, given that they do not wear down due to contact with stones.  The Crucible’s stomach is its most valuable part, as the flesh can be dried and rendered into a thick leather that is not only resistant to exceptionally acidic liquids, but also extreme heat.  This has made the stomach of the Crucible the ideal material for the construction of hazmat and fire brigade suits.
