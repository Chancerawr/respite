	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
<br/><br/>
	The sirens are a race of humanoid aberrations who are easily identified by the pulsating blue hue of their flesh.  Sirens can physically represent both sexes and their anatomy is identical to that of a human, suggesting that they are each some form of corrupted drifter.  Sirens are often naked and entirely lacking in clothing, but their torsos are concealed by a glowing cloud of blue haze that seems to float around them.  This cloud does react to the forces of wind or any air currents, but it is almost tethered to the Siren by some magnetic force.  
<br/><br/>
	Sirens earned their name due to their physical attractiveness and hallucinatory abilities.  They are not nefarious creatures, but they do tend to appear in areas where they can be meddlesome.  They are difficult to track, often vanishing after they move into concealment.  Despite walking on two legs, they do not leave footprints or any noticeable sign of their presence.  
<br/><br/>
	Sirens can be easily identified by not only their nakedness and trailing cloud of haze, but by their song (hence the name).  When in groups, sirens may hum and chant in an almost religious fashion.  This phenomena is not hallucinatory in any fashion, although it does have a tendency to attract the overly-curious.  
<br/><br/>
	<b>INTERACTION:</b>
<br/><br/>
	The threat that a Siren poses can be both direct and indirect.  Touching the body of a siren induces a sharp hallucination on the victim that can leave them indisposed for extended periods of time.  The ferocity of the hallucination seems to have a correlation with both the color and amount of hair on the Siren.  More powerful Sirens tend to have a darker blue hue to their flesh and are often devoid of any hair. They also tend to have the loudest songs.
<br/><br/>	
	The indirect threat of a Siren comes from its ability to hinder communications and to attract hostiles to its area.  The chant of the Siren can have a distortionary effect on radio transmissions in a similar fashion to a Blue Haze Anomaly.  At longer distances it will simply induce static and make transmissions more difficult to hear.  At medium distance the transmissions may cut out and suffer interference.  At close distances the transmissions cut out entirely and are often replaced with harsh static or white noise.
<br/><br/>
	The loudness of the chant determines how many creatures may come to the area.  Attracted by the sound, various abominations may attempt to encircle the Sirens or investigate in search of a meal.  When threatened a Siren will often vanish, but the fact that these other potentially hostile creatures do not share that ability may cause a horde of abominations to localize around their chant.
