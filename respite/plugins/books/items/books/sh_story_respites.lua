A respite is a mostly isolated world that can only be created by drifters. The contents of a respite can vary immensely. Each respite may have its own setting, climate, creatures, or dangers. They range from blank white space to sprawling modern cities with skyscrapers. 
	<br/><br/>
Respites can only be created by drifters. In theory, all drifters have a respite the first moment they step foot into the Void. They only need the tool to access, and enhance it. This tool is called the “Respite Orb”. It is a completely spherical object the puts off a dim light. This object is the key to a drifters own respite, and simply requires a shard, and a stable mind to take them there. The orb is an object made out of shards, a drifter simply putting together ten of them will immediately create their own personal respite orb, one that can only be used by them until the day they die. 
	<br/><br/>
At first, a drifter’s own respite is a blank slate, a white box. Only a drifter’s thoughts are required to change the entire contents of the respite at this point. Usually it will be transformed based on their personality, to something familiar. As the drifter adds shards to their orb, the respite’s space will increase, and as the respite grows, it will tend to follow the general theme of the existing setting. While a drifter can consciously change the setting at this point, it will take a good deal of time, and the respite will be completely unenterable for at least a few weeks.
	<br/><br/>
When a drifter opens his respite, others can go in as well. The portal into a respite will only close after the drifter has entered, and there are a variety of technologies a drifter can use to allow for others to enter as well. Through this method, drifters in the past have created massive cities with significantly lower danger than most abandoned respites. That is not to say that they are completely safe, just much safer.
	<br/><br/>
When the respite orb itself is destroyed, it will slowly repair itself. The time it takes for this to complete depends on the extent of the damage. At most, it will take an entire month to repair itself. During this period of time, the drifter will be unable to access their respite. If the drifter loses their orb, or misplaces it somehow. It will find its way back to the drifter eventually. Either by showing up at their bedside, or falling from the sky randomly, somehow it will make it back. If a drifter attempts to create a second respite orb, they will simply have another orb that leads to the same respite. 
	<br/><br/>
As more and more chips are added to the orb, plastics will begin to appear within the respite. These plastics are loyal to a drifter’s every command, and can be issued orders without even venturing into the respite through simple thought. Typically plastics will grow food for themselves and create themselves a home if left to their own devices. The extent of what these plastics can do is simply limited to what they have access to. They may be able to mine, scavenge, farm, fish, explore other respites, and much more. These plastics are also responsible for the defense of the respite. Abominations, drawn to each and every corner of the Void, will eventually appear within a drifter’s respite as well. It is part of these plastics’ jobs to fend them off. While abominations in personal respites are far less common, and less powerful, they are not to be left alone. 
	<br/><br/>
When a personal respite is overtaken by abominations, the mental state of the drifter will be negatively impacted. All sorts of terrible mental ailments such as hallucinations, constant headaches, unstable emotions, and much more will befall such a drifter. Eventually, if one's own respite is left in such a state for long enough, the drifter will perish.
	<br/><br/>
When the a drifter dies, the respite will always remain. At this point, it is an abandoned respite. Abandoned respites are essentially open to all other abandoned respites, and random portals from random locations will appear within it. These portals can bring any number and type of creatures. Such respites are the ones most often traversed by roaming drifters and refugee plastics. It is unknown the amount of abandoned respites that exist, but the number is thought to be well into the millions. There is nothing known that can restore or destroy an abandoned respite, and very few things can permanently alter them. 
	<br/><br/>
Intelligent creatures within a respite can have a large effect on the respite itself. This effect is increased substantially in abandoned respites. The thoughts and emotions of drifters can temporarily change the weather, the temperature, open portals, and much more, all unintentionally. This is a large part of the reason the blood haze reaction occurs at all, yet many drifters are not entirely aware of this fact. Plastics and aberrations, although intelligent, do not have as much of an effect. However, groups of plastics have been known to cause similar effects, implying that somehow a group has more unconscious environment changing power than a single plastic. This process is also thought to be the main source of abominations, and weaker shades. Feelings of anger and fear bring forth monstrosities born of nightmares straight out of the respite itself. Such creatures spread more anger and fear, creating a feedback loop that exists barely beneath the surface. As long as drifters live, so too will the abominations and shades born from their emotions.
	<br/><br/>
When something within an abandoned respite takes significant damage, and is altered to a large degree, it will be repaired by mysterious entities. These entities are orb, wisp-like beings seemingly made out of particles of light. They have no physical body, and generate a good deal of heat. They will ignore all creatures around them, repair whatever has been altered back to its original state, and then disappear without a trace or an explanation. What an object’s “original” state is can change over time. Otherwise, abandoned respites would almost always look pristine. As an abandoned respite ages, small changes build up in its environment, ones that essentially become the new original. It appears that only fast, immediate changes in the environment will cause the light entities to react. 
	<br/><br/>
In an experiment, researchers repeatedly burned down the same building in an abandoned respite. Each and every time, the orbs repaired the building. The positions and order to how they repaired the building changed, but the building was always restored to its previous state. One hundred times the building was burned down, but it was always repaired at the same speed, with no changes from before it was destroyed. However, the method for which the orbs repair was carefully examined during this time. While repairing the orbs project a very small beam towards the closest surface to them, and move themselves around, slowly scanning over everything in the area. As the surface is scanned, it is reverted to how it once was, bit by bit. While the method for how this works is difficult to determine, the leading theory is that they are replacing the damaged material with the respite’s “memory” of what it once was. These mysterious entities are thought to be part of the respite itself, some fragment of the drifter that once created it, but there is still much unknown about them, to the point that they are still unnamed.
	<br/><br/>
The respite of endless war, #7192, was once the largest recorded respite, and it was not abandoned at any point in its life. However, almost nothing is known about the one who first created it. It grew to such a size that there were multiple continents, and it began to seem more like an entire planet. This happened partly due to the constant abomination attacks. Powerful abominations would die within the respite, drop shards or shard dust from within themselves, only to be absorbed by the ground of the respite, which would increase its size. The increased size brought more drifters and plastics, but also more abominations and land to defend. Thus the endless war was born. There is no exact measurement of how large the respite ended up becoming, but so far no other recorded respite has likely come within even half its size.
