Chaos gas, or more formally, blue haze is a type of gaseous substance easily identified by its vibrant blue color. It can be found throughout a variety of respites, either appearing randomly as a form of weather, or simply residing within a section of the area permanently. This substance is often captured in bottles or other containers for a variety of uses, but is also a core component in the creation of an aberration.
	<br/><br/>
When a large quantity of blue haze enters an area, some electronics become distorted or inoperable. Most commonly radios or automated defenses completely stop functioning for the duration of the spectacle. There is little lingering damage however, and they will return to normal functionality the instant the haze has left. The presence of the gas also causes most abominations to go into hiding, and they will typically not attack until after it is gone.
	<br/><br/>
Blue haze causes intelligent beings to hallucinate when it is contacted. While being a gas, it can be inhaled, but also absorbed through bare skin, making it difficult to protect against. The hallucinations are typically random, nonsensical things, making it quite different from black haze. Those afflicted may hallucinate for several hours, but can vary depending on how much gas is absorbed. The hallucinations often render those afflicted incapable of combat or common sense. Some observed hallucinations are noted below.
	<br/><br/>
Twenty-seven flying banjos.<br/>
Dancing hamburgers, but one isn’t dancing and is just sad.<br/>
Cyborg hands, but the middle finger is golden.<br/>
Raining cats and dogs.<br/>
Guns that shoot spaghetti.<br/>
Walking bread people.<br/>
Fish vomiting.<br/>
Chairs with legs.
	<br/><br/>
While a gas mask is insufficient for full protection from the gas, it does delay the effects and reduce the severity of the hallucinations. This makes it a necessity if one ever has to venture out into a gas filled area.
	<br/><br/>
Aberrations exposed to the blue haze weather are both healed and enhanced. The enhancements generally pertain to their unique abilities or bodies, but are not permanent. All enhancements from blue haze typically revert after at most, a day. That being said, it is wise to avoid aberrations during, or shortly after a weather event. Even peaceful, or exceedingly weak aberrations may gain the strength necessary to fight a group of heavily armed drifters, or to wipe out a settlement. Aberrations that are exposed to enough blue haze may develop permanent enhancements, but simply sitting outside in a blue haze storm is not enough, it would require the collection of the substance in great amounts.
	<br/><br/>
Abominations, when exposed to haze, will be rendered slow, and sluggish. Their reaction times will be vastly reduced, and their lust for blood significantly weakened. That is not to say such an abomination is harmless, but it is far easier to deal with a sluggish abomination than a regular one. 
	<br/><br/>
Wraiths and shades are not slowed or rendered sluggish by haze, but it can be used in a similar fashion. Neither type of creature can see or perceive anything within or behind haze. This means that a drifter coated or surrounded in the substance will be seemingly invisible in the eyes of a wraith. However, caution is advised. Wraiths can also utilize haze in order to assimilate more wraiths if left unchecked. More powerful shades can turn blue haze into black haze, and manipulate it to turn the tables. That being the case, it is best to use blue haze only if it is truly necessary, otherwise unexpected situations may happen.
	<br/><br/>
Blue haze collects itself near water, and many drifters use this fact to collect the gas within bottles of water. Simply leaving a half full bottle of water out in a storm yields a full bottle of haze, which can then be used for recreation (not advised), or the creation of blue haze bombs.
	<br/><br/>
The gas is strongly related to the creation of aberrations, and can be used to directly create them for a variety of purposes. Creating a single aberration can take quite a deal of haze, and there is almost no telling what the abilities or the temperament of the created creature will be, making the process significantly dangerous if done haphazardly. Creating an aberration requires first, blue haze, and quite the amount of it. The amount of haze is also proportional to the power of the created creature. The other necessary ingredient is any sort of object at all. The added haze will use the object as a base, or a host, creating an abomination that incorporates it in some way. This technique is often used to form replacement limbs, or strange weaponry. 
	<br/><br/>
Aberration limbs can be life saving, but also deadly. It is important to note that any aberration is to some degree, alive, and its mind will not always bend to the will of its user. However, aberration users with proper mental stability and fortitude can find themselves with amazing power depending on the aberration. Those of weaker will may find themselves being controlled by their own limb, or being attacked by it. Aberration weapons may turn on their user, or simply stop functioning at all. It is best to avoid using such unreliable weapons and tools if possible, but their usefulness is not to be disregarded.
	<br/><br/>
Limbs:<br/>
15 bottles : Strength comparable to original limb, somewhat difficult to control for weak willed.<br/>
(5+ will roll needed)<br/>
30 bottles : Far stronger than regular arm, more difficult to control.<br/>
(10+ will roll needed)<br/>
45 bottles : Limb has a personality, and its own desires, incredibly difficult to control, may attempt to destroy its host.<br/>
(15+ will roll needed)
	<br/><br/>
Organs: <br/>
15 bottles : Performs the same as regular organ, sometimes causes blue haze hallucinations.<br/>
30 bottles : Far better performance, enhancing body depending on organ. Nearly constant blue haze hallucinations.<br/>
45 bottles : High risk of transforming the entire drifter into an aberration, this will destroy the drifter’s memories and personality.
	<br/><br/>
Replacing the brain of any creature with blue haze will always turn the creature into an aberration. The power of said aberration will vary depending on the strength of the creature pre transformation. The new aberration will have no memories of what it was before, and its personality may be completely different as well. 
	<br/><br/>
Unlike plastics, an aberration created by a drifter will have no innate memory of loyalties to said Drifters, and it may attack them immediately after creation, thus it is very important to be prepared in such a circumstance. The greater the amount of haze used in the creation of the aberration, the greater its strength will be.
	<br/><br/>
Creatures:<br/>
15 bottles : fairly weak aberration, may lack intelligence. Chance of rebelling low.<br/>
(5+ will roll needed)<br/>
30 bottles : Can be just as capable as a drifter in terms of physical abilities and intelligence. Chance of rebelling moderate.<br/>
(10+ will roll needed)<br/>
45 bottles : Powerful aberration, could have devastating abilities. Chance of rebelling high.<br/>
(20+ will roll needed)<br/>
100+ bottles : Unspeakable terror. Avoid at all costs. <br/>
(50+ will roll needed)
