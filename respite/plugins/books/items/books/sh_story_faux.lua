The Faux is a subsection of the Void that seemingly has a different form of respite than the rest of the Void. The Faux is also known as the Lower Void.
	<br/><br/>
Within the Faux are a collection of worlds that are separate from one another much like the rest of the Void. Within each of these worlds there is often a world much similar to real life. There are no typical Void creatures, and those who are trapped within them often believe that they are in the real world. This is the origin of a drifter. All of a drifter's memories will be created in their own personal world in the Faux. While in the Faux they will have no memories of the actual real world that they came from, and they will essentially live a life of their own in the Faux. In a certain way, even though the life in the Faux is not exactly “real”, it is still real to many people, and upon learning of this, many will take drastic measures in order to return to the place they came from. Another devastating piece of information is that since every memory a fresh drifter will have will be from the Faux, it is very likely that the person they are in the real world is a completely different person with a completely different personality. This often leads to what is called the multiple lives conundrum.
	<br/><br/>
The multiple lives conundrum is the choice of which life is the “real” life for a particular drifter. There is the Faux life, the life that they have the memories of, and the world that formed their personality, and there is the real life, the life that happened in the actual real world, outside of the Void. Typically a drifter will have little to no memories of their real life, and will have no idea what the world is like for them outside of the Void. There is no objective answer to the conundrum, which leads to many drifters remaining as drifters, roaming until they find an answer. Many find that there is no answer, and simply continue to live their new lives in the Void. 
	<br/><br/>
When a drifter dies in most normal ways, their consciousness is sent back to the Faux, where they essentially resume their life before they left the Faux. Typically the memories of their life as a drifter fade away, and feel more like a dream than something that actually happened to them. This being the case, many unstable individuals, or those who have a strong desire to return to their lives will commit suicide in order to return to the Faux and reclaim who they once were. When a drifter returns to the Faux, they likely will not leave again. However, there have been rare cases where this has happened, but those who came out again had distorted memories, and incredibly blighted bodies. 
	<br/><br/>
When using blight, a drifter will experience feelings of the Faux, and in cases of overdose, will be sent directly back there, turning their body into a shadow statue. Black haze storms can sometimes simulate a drifter’s Faux world, showing them things they left behind. Voices and whispers from loved ones, a familiar song, or even the smell of one’s favorite food. There have even been cases of drifters having full conversations with those they used to know in such storms. While seemingly heartwarming, these interactions can lure a drifter into danger, and lead to their death if caution is not exercised.
	<br/><br/>
Shades created from drifters draw much of their power from their personal Faux worlds, which allows them to grow in power and strengthen their life force. Typically stronger shades have larger Faux worlds, and with larger Faux world comes stronger ties and emotions linked to it. This can result in more powerful shades becoming incredibly unstable and potentially violent if reminded of their pasts. The strength and size of a shade’s Faux world can be increased by consuming excess blight, or by consuming or merging with other shades in order to make use of their Faux world. There are likely other methods used by shades for this purpose, but there is a lack of reliable data in order to draw more significant conclusions about them.
