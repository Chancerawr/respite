	The Faux is a subsection of the Void that seemingly has a different form of respite than the rest of the Void. The Faux is also known as the Lower Void, or the Lie.
<br/><br/>
	Within the Faux are a collection of worlds that are separate from one another much like the rest of the Void. Within each of these worlds there is often a world much similar to real life. There are no typical Void creatures, and those who are trapped within them often believe that they are in the real world. This is the origin of a drifter. All of a drifter's memories will be created in their own personal respite in the Faux. While in the Faux they will have no memories of the actual real world that they came from, and they will essentially live a life of their own in the Faux. In a certain way, even though the life in the Faux is not exactly “real”, it is still real to many people, and upon learning of this, many will take drastic measures in order to return to the place they came from. Another devastating piece of information is that since every memory a fresh drifter will have will be from the faux, it is very likely that the person they are in the real world, is a completely different person with a completely different personality. This often leads to what is called the multiple lives conundrum that many experienced drifters will have to decide upon eventually.
<br/><br/>
	The multiple lives conundrum is the choice of which life is the “real” life for a particular drifter. There is the Faux life, the life that they have the memories of, and the world that formed their personality, and there is the real life, the life that happened in the actual real world, outside of the Void. Typically a drifter will have little to no memories of their real life, and will have no idea what the world is like for them outside of the Void. There is no objective answer to the conundrum, which leads to many drifters remaining as drifters, roaming until they find an answer. Many find that there is no answer, and simply continue to live their new lives in the Void. 
<br/><br/>
	When a drifter dies in most normal ways, their consciousness is sent back to the Faux, where they essentially resume their life before they left the Faux. Typically the memories of their life as a drifter fade away, and feel more like a dream than something that actually happened to them. This being the case, many simply commit suicide so that they can go back to living their life in the Faux.
<br/><br/>
	In using CURE or other blighted instruments, a drifter will experience feelings of the Faux, and in cases of overdose, will be sent directly back there, turning their body into a shadow statue. Black haze storms are also known to make use of a drifter’s Faux world. Many report seeing people they used to know walking around. Others have heard the voices of their loved ones calling to them. It is important to recognize the deceit of a haze storm, and not be lured into a dangerous situation by a familiar voice.
<br/><br/>
	Shades created from drifters draw much of their power from their personal Faux worlds, which CURE (blight) allows them to grow and strengthen. The stronger the shade, the larger the Faux world, and the more powerful the emotions linked to it. This can result in more powerful shades becoming incredibly unstable and violent if reminded of their pasts. 
<br/><br/>
	There are rare cases where someone who was sent back to the Faux manages to escape it again. Usually their bodies are incredibly blighted and their memories are unstable. Such a person should avoid contact with shades at all costs, as they will be exceptionally vulnerable to any blighted attacks, and could be sent back to the Faux easily if they take any sort of blight damage.
