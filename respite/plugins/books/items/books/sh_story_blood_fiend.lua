Plastics fear and worship the shards, and with good reason. Upon making direct physical contact with a shard or anything made out of shards they will fundamental change, and become a different type of creature. Plastics can either become blood fiends, or much more rarely crystallize into something called a crystalline.
	<br/><br/>
Blood fiends are creatures that are still somewhat humanoid, including tool and weapon use, but have traits and behaviors similar to abominations. They are easily identified by their foul stench of decay, and constant production of blood. That being the case, locations that fiends reside in are also very easy to identify due to the presence of blood on the floors, walls and sometimes ceiling.
	<br/><br/>
After most shard related infections, the plastic will look no different. However, simply put, the creature is no longer a plastic. Its entire being has been corrupted irreversibly. It is safe to assume that if a plastic does not crystallize after touching a shard, it is definitely a fiend. 
	<br/><br/>
Fiends have multiple developmental stages after shard corruption. 
	<br/><br/>
The first stage can last anywhere to a few minutes, or a few weeks. The plastic at this time will definitely know they are corrupted, but will have not intentions of alerting anyone or anything. A plastic in this state will revert to a mostly basic behavioral set, and will respond with basic writing or hand signals. It will eat, sleep, and drink, but it will not have complex thoughts, and its emotions will slowly disappear entirely. Some fiends in this phase have been known to hide their infection and make preparations to infect other plastics.
	<br/><br/>
The second stage is when physical characteristics appear. This stage can last a week to a month. The plastic's head will begin to form a large opening, generally in the place where a mouth would normally be on a human. The hole will consistently leak reddish blood at a rate depending on the size of the hole. This opening will cut into the creature’s head horizontally, so the blood will pool up to the top, and flow over when the creature moves. This area will widen and expand more the further into the stage the creature is. The final hole size may end up being half of the creature's head. Along with this, smaller, pin-like holes will often form randomly all over the fiend’s body, just like the head, they will constantly leak a reddish blood at all times. The blood produced by fiends can infect other plastics and turn them into fiends. Infection only requires that the blood somehow get inside a plastic’s body. Fiends make this their goal when fighting plastics, they have a primal desire to spread the infection, they will even prioritize it above their own lives. The typical strategy of a fiend in this stage is to wrap their head openings over the heads of other plastics, and flood them with the vile substance. This can sometimes accelerate the process, and immediately turn them into a stage two fiend. This combined with blood covered weapons makes safely fighting fiends nearly impossible for a plastic. Fiends in stage two are completely capable of using any weapons a regular plastic can use, and are also capable of tactics and problem solving. Fiends in this state will be hostile to all creatures other than fiends.
	<br/><br/>
Stage three is the last known stage. During stage three, the fiend sprouts teeth around the strange hole formed on its head, and the opening quickly morphs into a powerful mouth capable of tearing apart abominations and drifters alike. Against plastics, it will still try to corrupt them just like in stage two, however it will give up on this task if it proves too difficult. A simple bite from this creature can be enough to infect a plastic, if they survive anwyays. In that case, the plastic will not be immediately converted to the second stage, and will instead be in the first stage. Where theere were once pin-like holes, there are now sharp, bone-like spikes that provide defense from close ranged attackers. This stage three creature is stronger, faster, and more resilient than a typical plastic or fiend. It will not die until its head is removed or destroyed. It will continue to fight onwards without arms, legs, sometimes a decapitated head may still attempt to move, and even attack. It is recommended that it be burned it sliced to pieces after removal.
	<br/><br/>
Fiends of all stages can survive entirely without food, but typically eating allows them to regenerate and repair their bodies. In the case of later staged fiends, excessive consumption can lead to further mutations. Most fiends are also known to have a ravenous hunger for meat, despite it not being necessary for their survival. 
	<br/><br/>
The blood that leaks from a fiend is seemingly endless, and at no point do they stop producing the corrupted blood until they are no longer alive. To reduce the chance of further fiends, it is advised to burn all objects that came in contact with them to prevent future plastic infections.
	<br/><br/>
Fiends can be created by shard infused weaponry, which, in the past, has been abused to spread chaos throughout the ranks of plastics. Plastics will almost never use shard weaponry for this reason, as the risks are simply too high. When used by plastics, it typically results in a disaster scenario for any and all plastics in the area. Generally plastics either flee entire respites to escape fiends, or fight them carefully and ruthlessly. Plastics that choose to fight fiends do so with utmost ruthlessness, torching anything that potentially made contact with fiends, and scrutinizing others for signs of fiend traits.
	<br/><br/>
Since fiend blood only infects plastics, drifters do not have to fear getting it inside of their bodies. However, this does not prevent fiends from trying, as they will still grapple and attempt to flood a drifter with the vile substance. While it does not infect them, they can still drown in it, and it has been known to evoke flu-like symptoms for a few days as well. It is also disorienting and disgusting, and most believe it to be the worst tasting thing imaginable. If a drifter ally is being grappled, it is best to help them sooner rather than later.
	<br/><br/>
Stage three fiends are capable of somewhat intelligent actions and tactics, some even continue to use sign language to command and instruct other fiends. Such fiends often find wandering plastics, infect them, and then release them nearby other plastics to spread infection. It is unknown whether or not these creatures make these decisions consciously, or just instinctively do them, but regardless, they are not to be underestimated. 
	<br/><br/>
Fiends can construct plastics from plastic and chips just like other void creatures can, which clearly leads to the construction of more fiends. Constructed fiends usually start out in stage two, but variations can occur. Since fiends consistently attempt to create more fiends, there are often times where their home area cannot support all of them. When this happens, some fiends will group up, and leave the area in search of more resources, plastics to infect, or more areas in to inhabit. Fiends sent out in this case are usually in stage two, but sometimes in stage one. Stage three fiends may leave their encampment from time to time, but almost always return some time later. A fiend nest becomes more dangerous the longer it exists, meaning that it is critical to destroy it as fast as possible to prevent its growth and further spreading.
