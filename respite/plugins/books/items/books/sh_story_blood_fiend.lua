	Plastics often fear and worship the shards, and with good reason.
		<br/><br/>
	When a Plastic makes direct physical contact with a shard, they either crystallize or mutate into abomination-like creatures known as Blood Fiends, or just Fiends for short.	
		<br/><br/>
	Since this interaction requires direct physical contact, handling shards with gloves or any other protection does work. However, it is something Plastics still prefer to avoid unless necessary.
		<br/><br/>
	Once the Fiend is first created, it is indistinguishable from the Plastic before it was changed. This is clear sign that the Plastic has been corrupted, as if a Plastic makes contact with a shard, and does not crystallize, it can only mean they are now a Fiend. No Plastics are immune to this interaction, and it is irreversible.
		<br/><br/>
	Fiends have multiple developmental stages after shard corruption. 	
		<br/><br/>
	The first stage can last anywhere to a few minutes, or a few weeks. The Plastic at this time will definitely know they are corrupted, but will be mostly unable to alert others. A plastic this state will revert to a mostly basic behavioral set, it will respond with basic writing or hand signals, it will eat, sleep, and drink. But it will not have complex thoughts, and its emotions will slowly disappear entirely. Some Fiends in this phase have been known to hide their infection and make preparations to infect other Plastics.
		<br/><br/>
	The second stage is when physical characteristics first appear. This stage can last a week to a month. The plastic's head will begin to form a large opening, generally in the place where a mouth would normally be on a human. The hole will consistently leak humanoid blood at a rate depending on the size of the hole. This opening will cut into the creature’s head horizontally, so the blood will pool up to the top, and flow over when the creature is idle. This area will widen and expand more the further into the stage the creature is. The final hole size may end up being half of the creature's head. Along with this, smaller, pin-like holes will often form randomly all over the Fiend’s body, just like the head, they will consistently bleed humanoid blood. Of particular note is that the blood bled from a Fiend is infectious, but only to Plastics. The blood simply needs to make contact with a Plastics mouth region, or an open wound. Fiends make this their goal when fighting Plastics, they have a primal desire to spread the infection. They will wrap their head openings over the heads of other Plastics, and flood them with the vile substance. This can accelerate the process, and immediately turn them into stage two Fiends. This makes them particularly terrifying for any Plastic. Plastics in stage two are completely capable of using weapons and firearms. Tactics are also utilized, and Fiends of this stage know little fear, they only seek to spread their disease and destroy anything else that moves, including Drifters, Abominations, and Aberrations.
		<br/><br/>
	Stage three is the last known stage. During stage three, the Fiend sprouts teeth around the strange hole formed on its head, and the opening quickly morphs into a powerful mouth capable of tearing apart Abominations and Drifters alike. Against Plastics, it will still try to corrupt them just like in stage two, however it will give up on this task if it proves too difficult. A simple bite from this creature is enough to infect a Plastic, but it will not be immediately converted to the second stage, and will instead be in the first stage. The pin-like holes from before are now sharp, bone-like spikes. This stage three creature is stronger, faster, and more resilient than a typical Plastic or Fiend. It will not die until its head is removed or destroyed. It will continue to fight onwards without arms, legs, sometimes a decapitated head may still attempt to move, and even attack. It is recommended that it be burned it sliced to pieces after removal.
		<br/><br/>
	Fiends of all stages regenerate their bodies by consuming flesh or plastic. However, they can survive entirely without food, and generally only consume plastic to regenerate their bodies in times of injury. They may not need to eat to survive, but have a ravenous hunger for meat, abomination or otherwise. Fiends that have fed abundantly are observably stronger than freshly created Fiends.
		<br/><br/>
	The blood that leaks from a Fiend is seemingly endless, at no point do they stop leaking the corrupted blood until they are no longer alive. To reduce the chance of further Fiends, it is advised to burn all objects that came in contact with them as Plastics can be corrupted by contaminated food or by getting injured with bloodied weapons.
		<br/><br/>
	Fiends can be created by shard weapons, resulting in terrifying biological warfare avoided by all Plastics. In the case of its use, it typically results in an apocalyptic scenario for any and all Plastic factions involved. Generally Plastics either flee entire Respites to escape Fiends, or fight them carefully and ruthlessly, they often leave nothing unburnt, destroying anything and anyone suspected of being corrupted.
		<br/><br/>
	Drifters have little to fear of the corrupted blood they spew, but it is thick and nauseating, the smell of rot and decay is a notable factor for those with weak stomachs. 	
		<br/><br/>
	Fiends still attempt to fruitlessly corrupt Drifters by grappling them and then flooding their mouths and noses with the corrupted blood, this may not infect them, but it can result in drowning or suffocation, so Fiends should not be fought alone, lest you enjoy drowning in rotting corrupted blood.
		<br/><br/>
	Stage three fiends are capable of seemingly higher than Abomination intelligence. A stage three fiend may choose to pick off a lone Plastic belonging to a nearby camp, infect it with a simple bite or a head grapple, and then release it to infect the rest of the camp over time. For this reason, organized Plastics almost never travel alone.
