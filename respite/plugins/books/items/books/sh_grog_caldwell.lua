		<b>ALIASES:</b> Wellington (actual surname?), Middle One, Artisan, Cald2
<br/><br/>
		<b>STATUS:</b> Living
<br/><br/>
		<b>AFFILIATION:</b> Cald, Shark Separatist & Cald Coalition (Present)
<br/><br/>
		<b>VISUAL DESCRIPTION:</b>
<br/><br/>
		[Standard] N/A
<br/><br/>
		[Shade] Figure has a body of an adult male of middling stature and build.  Figure seems to emulate the appearance of tight clothing, with the head sporting what looks like a solid welding mask made of blight.  At times, shade may utilize a custom mechanized rig to facilitate construction or machining efforts.  We believe that this rig can be repurposed into a combat role.
<br/><br/>
		<b>ABILITIES:</b>
<br/><br/>
		[Shade] Abilities typical of a non-alpha shade.  Shade possesses extraordinary dexterity when manipulating and shaping physical objects, particularly when doing so to construct something. The limits of what can be constructed seem to depend on the ability to deconstruct that same item, or the individual components.  This suggests that in order to actually construct something, he requires materials and a familiarity with it.  This is further reinforced by the fact that memories are often utilized in the production process.  
<br/><br/>
		<b>COMBAT:</b>
<br/><br/>
		There are no recorded instances or reports of this shade engaging in hostilities with any other entity.  It seems that they function in a ‘support’ role rather than as an active combatant.  However, we do believe that their incredible familiarity with constructing and deconstructing machinery brings with it familiarity with operation.  Similar to Stiltskin, it may be best to use incredibly simple weapons should the need to engage arise.
