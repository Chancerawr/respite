		<font color='black' size='3'>The Plastics are a type of creature that live in The Void (where the server takes place.) They have human like traits, personalities, and beliefs. However, their bodies are made entirely of plastic, similar to a mannequin. Most do not have mouths, or eyes. Their ears are also relatively simply. Despite this, they can still see, and hear. However, they cannot smell, and they cannot speak.
		<br/><br/>
There are some cases where these creatures may have some of these features, but it is very rare. (If you want to RP one of these cases, mention it in your application.) Generally those with extra features are considered to be more elite, and tend to have more social standing.
		<br/><br/>
Plastics understand languages, however usually only one. Some may not understand English. They also have their own written language that all Plastics know.
		<br/><br/>
The background of these characters can vary wildly, as they come from many different locations. Some may have been simply villagers, or civilians in their own cities in other worlds in The Void. Others may have been soldiers for a Drifter dictator.
		<br/><br/>
Since the bodies of Plastics are not made of human flesh, they do not heal normally. Instead, they have to repair their bodies with "Plastic Dust," a substance collected from mannequins and other Plastics. They do not bleed, but they will die if they have an open wound for too long, or their organs are destroyed. The bodies of one of these creatures are generally slightly more fragile than a standard humans' in combat. 
		<br/><br/>
Plastics do not feel cold, but they do feel pain, hunger, and thirst. They do not have mouths, so they simply press the food to their faces and it disappears. A starved Plastic will have difficulty moving its body. One that starves to death will harden in place, and become a plastic statue. Even though they do not feel cold, and have few features to hide, they tend to wear clothing.
		<br/><br/>
Plastics can use all types of weapons, so long as they know how to.
		<br/><br/>
Plastics generally use E.N.D. chips are currency rather than using scraps like most drifters. They also fear and worship shards and the crystalline objects they form. It is rare for a Plastic to wish to directly touch one, due to superstition. They will often build altars around shards, and place offerings nearby.
		<br/><br/>
Plastics are not friendly with the abominations in Respite, they are often in constant war with them in their home worlds. Plastics also sometimes have wars within their own race. They are mostly neutral with Drifters, and tend to avoid them if possible. However, there are many groups of them that will fight anything that gets in their way.
		<br/><br/>
Plastics are immune to electricity.
		<br/><br/>
(Note: Characters like these are not ones to live long, they are essentially the fodder of The Void, and typically fight in numbers to compensate for their weaknesses. Expect to die if you make one of these. These are like hardmode characters or something, if you want to think of it like that.)
