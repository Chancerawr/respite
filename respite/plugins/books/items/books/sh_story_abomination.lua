Abominations are a type of creature that all drifters will likely encounter at one point or another. They come in many shapes and sizes, and their abilities and the actions they take can vary. However, untamed abominations are always hostile, and even tamed or trained abominations would not hesitate to attack their trainer if given ample opportunity.
	<br/><br/>
Abominations are similar to aberrations in many ways, but are always aggressive and usually lack critical thought and a survival instinct. Abominations defy common sense in how their bodies work. Most do not need to breathe, and also lack organs that would be necessary for the survival of such a creature. It is not uncommon for an abomination to die of natural causes within the same day it was created.
	<br/><br/>
The thought processes of abominations typically defy common sense as well. They are mostly instinctual, and the highest priority for them is to destroy living things, even other abominations in some cases. They will attempt to do anything for this purpose, even take actions that are borderline, if not fully suicidal. An abomination may rush head first into a spear, just to attempt to strike the wielder behind it. Fortunately, this can make weaker, less intelligent abominations very predictable. However, stronger creatures may employ more advanced tactics. There are also some strange cases where abominations may capture a drifter for a variety of purposes. This is typically only done by borderline aberrative creatures, but it is certain that death will come to those captured by abominations if enough time passes.
	<br/><br/>
Abominations are created by feelings of hatred and fear by drifters and groups of plastics in an abandoned respite. Extreme cases can result in massive creatures, or the arrival of a large, meaty pillar that will in turn create more creatures. Some abominations can also create more of themselves, such creatures are not particularly uncommon, but are usually only found in heavily infested areas. Usually, abominations will enter a respite by simply appearing on the fringe, or crawling from the ground itself. There are many situations, such as blood haze, where they will enter through strange, crack-like portals from abomination infested respites. It is also not uncommon for blood red portals to randomly open within a respite that act in a similar way.
	<br/><br/>
Abominations are strengthened and mutated by shards, but corroded and weakened by blight. Making them about the opposite of shades in that regard. If shades are to be considered creatures of blight, abominations would be creatures of shards. This is further evident by abominations that fully incorporate shards or shard dust into their bodies. It is very unwise to ever allow an abomination to make contact with a shard, as its powers and strength will grow unpredictably, and it will likely become even more aggressive and dangerous. This also seems linked to the effects shards can have on plastics, as most would say that a fiend is a combination of plastic and abomination.
	<br/><br/>
In line with them being creatures of shards, they are also attracted to light, and will generally gravitate towards it if they are not already occupied. However, that is not to say that abominations that lurk within the darkness are in any way uncommon. Rather, this effect is generally only for extreme light sources, such as flares. It is a commonly used strategy to deploy a flare at the end of a darkened area in order to lure the abominations within outside for a less dangerous encounter. Conversely, this paints a target on drifters who made the mistake of illuminating the wrong location at the wrong time.
	<br/><br/>
Blue haze has a strange, non lethal effect on abominations. It typically leaves them groggy, and docile for a temporary amount of time. In combat this is typically used to slow their movements, and make them less likely to unleash their more powerful attacks. Using blue haze during combat rarely fully pacifies an already enraged creature, but using it on a creature that has yet to detect an enemy, it can be used to make them docile for training purposes. 
	<br/><br/>
Ichor, if enough of it enters the body of an abomination, will easily turn it into a wraith. Abominations are specifically the easiest creatures to turn into wraiths, this trait is attributed to their lack of intelligent thought. Typically the amount of ichor required for this wraith transformation is related to how large the creature is, and in many cases a single vial will be all that is necessary. However, it is generally a bad idea to turn abominations into wraiths, as there is often little to gain. Wraiths will almost always prioritize drifters, rather than the other abominations, so it does not even work as a decent distraction most of the time.
	<br/><br/>
Generally a trainer will first find an abomination, make it docile with blue haze, and then begin to train it for whatever purpose one would need to train an abomination for. These trained abominations see some success among plastics at war with other plastics, but can be dangerous due to how fickle such a creatureâ€™s loyalty is. It is said that a well trained abomination will destroy all of your enemies, and then you, hopefully in that order. It is important for all trainers to acknowledge that an abomination will never feel anything towards its owner, and will quickly turn on them if given the chance.
