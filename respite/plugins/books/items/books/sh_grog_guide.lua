	There are certain threats in these Respites that remind us of ourselves.  
<br/><br/>	
	The plastics are as human as you and I, but their hard outer shell and usually pale appearance is a constant reminder that while what lives within them is human, what we perceive on the exterior is by no means the same.
<br/><br/>	
	Aberrations, shades, the same can be said for them; many shades in particular are known to have retained at least a small part of who they were prior to their conversion.  Some shades became entirely new people.  
<br/><br/>	
	Some of the monsters that walk this void resemble humans, but whose minds have been corrupted beyond repair and their bodies physically mutilated to remind us that they are no longer one of us.  But, among them are a sort of zombie, dead drifters who have been brought back to act as slaves via some sort of necromancy.
<br/><br/>	
	The monsters I am presenting to you here today are similar to that group of resurrected dead, but far, far more dangerous than shambling corpses with little cognition.  These creatures are fully aware, look entirely human, but have eyes and hearts so devoid of emotion that they are certainly monsters.  They are humanity at its most base form, and for their emptiness of both humanity, personality, and empathy, they are known as Los Envases.
<br/><br/>	
	Identifying an Envase, or “Empty” (thank you Maria for that quality translation work) is difficult at long range, easy at medium or close range, and pointless at near ranges.  By the time you are within several feet of an Empty, they already know that you are there and getting ready to turn you into one of them.
<br/><br/>	
	The key identifying feature of an Envase that sets them apart from us is the fact that they usually wear large metal canisters on their backs that have hoses connected to a breathing apparatus (usually a converted gas mask).  These hoses pump a thin grey gas into their bodies, and we think that gas is somehow recycled and constantly pumped in and out via the nose and mouth of the creature.
<br/><br/>	
	Exactly what this grey gas does is largely unknown to us, but it seems that it is the key to the existence of these things.  The gas must flow in order for these creatures to survive, meaning that destroying the breathing apparatus or the tank should at least guarantee a kill eventually.  However, the reason we must emphasize eventually is the fact that the “death” is not immediate; so long as there is some gas in their body, they will continue to walk.  Destroying the tank or rupturing the flow either slackens the amount entering the body or produces a leakage that will hasten the consumption of the gas.
<br/><br/>	
	On that note, we should point out that the primary objective of these things is two-fold: secure bodies, and secure gas.  Both of these objectives contribute to one larger goal, which seems to just be to enlarge their ranks.  This means that should these creatures succeed in a combat engagement against Nomads, they will likely replenish all of their losses and also gain strength.  Exactly how they replenish their gas, on the other hand, is still unknown to us.
<br/><br/>	
	On the topic of combat, we finally move onto exactly how they behave, and what you need to look out for.  They are mostly human.  Unlike a dead drifter, which will just wear whatever clothes it has on and can still barely operate its weapons, these things are fully aware of their surroundings, know how to operate weapons, are not affected by the crimson tide, are largely autonomous and only rely on their group for survival rather than some necromancer, and worst of all they seem to be capable of construction.  This means that also unlike dead drifters, these creatures may produce their own armor, weapons, bullets, and on some occasions even fortifications or vehicles (yes, somehow these things can still fucking drive).  
<br/><br/>	
	There is a slight, slight silver lining to this.  If you are part of the 0.5% of plastics who can actually read this book, congratulations! For some reason, Empties don’t give a shit about killing you guys unless provoked, whereas they will absolutely hunt down and destroy any drifters they come across in a relentless fashion.  
<br/><br/>	
	Here are some other interesting bits of information that our scouts, travelers, and survivors of encounters with these creatures have found:
<br/><br/>	
	  -  Grey gas tanks are NOT explosive, but are compressed and sealed
<br/><br/>	
	  -  Shooting the brain seems slightly effective, but surprisingly is not a guaranteed kill
<br/><br/>	
	  -  Fully automatic fire on center mass recommended, bullet wounds in the torso area seem to cause holes for gas to leak from to expedite death.
<br/><br/>	
	  -  Seem to communicate via hand signals, and strangely enough some plastics have pointed out that they also sometimes use plastic sign language.  This suggests that they may still be able to learn and adapt
<br/><br/>	
	  -  Lack of memory ties into lack of empathy.  Empties do not recognize familiar faces, even if you recognize a familiar face among the empties.  DO NOT PRACTICE DIPLOMACY WITH THEM. YOU WILL DIE!
<br/><br/>	
	  -  Most weapons, particularly firearms, that are carried by these creatures have a chrome color to them and seem to smell like blood.  The intricacy of the design and the strength of the smell seem to indicate their rank or ability
<br/><br/>	
	  -  DO NOT PICK UP THE WEAPONS WITH THE INTRICATE ENGRAVINGS, THEY MAY CAUSE YOU TO GO BERSERK
<br/><br/>	
	  -  If you are overwhelmed by the enemy, cannot retreat, and are likely to be killed, make sure you shoot yourself under the chin, through the roof of your mouth, and into your brain.  Several dead Empties we have found had old bullet wounds in the sides of their heads, but almost none have wounds like that (and if they do, the grey gas seems to come out of the hole).
<br/><br/>	
	With all of this in mind, remember one last thing: if you see an empty, do not engage.  It’s not worth it.
