ITEM.desc = "Pauldrons that protect the shoulders crafted from old license plates. The plates are fastened together through the use of zipties in holes that once housed screws, and provide a small amount of protection against firearms on the shoulders.  The plates are vulnerable to blunt strikes, but impervious to stabbing and slashing."
