ITEM.desc = "A modern-ish take on the medieval cuirass, this 2.6MM thick steel breastplate clocks in at just under 8 pounds.  At a range of 100 meters, the plate can easily stop any pistol caliber munitions fired at it and may even stop a rifle-caliber cartridge. Unfortunately, the substantial protection offered comes at the cost of limited mobility and the retention of vulnerabilities on the backside. Most importantly however, it protects your crotch."
